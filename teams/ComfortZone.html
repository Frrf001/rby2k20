		This team is designed to be similar to an RBY OU team, with a couple of straightforward new Pokemon added to it to make it a viable team in the metagame. Like a traditional RBY OU team, pressure is generated by a combination of a sleeper (in this case, Butterfree) and paralysis (from multiple sources) enabling snorlax to break open the opponent's team in the early game and Tauros to clean in the late game.
    </p>
    <p>
  There are a number of key threats to look out for when playing this team. <b>Opposing Butterfree</b> can be difficult to make progress against:  Nidoqueen, which is weak to Psychic, is the only Pokemon on the team which resists Leech Life, and Chansey and Snorlax provide the potential of enormous recovery for Butterfree through Leech Life, so denying it recovery is challenging. Nidoqueen's Rock Slide can surprise Butterfree and do a lot of damage, and the team's own Butterfree can somewhat neutralise the opponent's, but otherwise it is difficult to prevent opposing Butterfrees from taking advantage of the team.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Moltres</b> can be quite a significant threat to the team. It is bulky and extremely powerful, and the team has few ways to cope with it. Chansey is the team's best tool, able to paralyze it and take boosted attacks from Moltres. Seismic Toss ignores Solar Beam's boost to Moltres' Special, helping it put Moltres on a timer, but against Rest variants of Moltres, especially with Sky Attack or Reflect to prevent it from being fodder once asleep, it is not enough. Nidoqueen's Rock Slide can be used to force Moltres out once it's paralyzed. Beyond that, Starmie's STAB Surf and Snorlax's and Tauros's physical power can be used to help keep it in check, but aren't enough to stop it if it gets going, except with Snorlax's-Self Destruct.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Golduck</b> is a defensive threat that is extremely difficult to get around. With its immunity to Normal-type moves, it can nullify Snorlax and Tauros without too much difficulty. Against a team with it, there's little you can do to break it beyond trying to critical hit it repeatedly with Earthquakes, freezing it with Tauros's Blizzard, or trying to PP stall its rest with Chansey.  
  </p>
  <p>
  The biggest threat from opposing Dream Eater teams is usually going to be <b>Poliwrath</b>. An upside of having the traditional core of Snorlax, Chansey, and Tauros is that half of the team is immune to Dream Eater, but the downside is that half of the team is weak to Fighting-type attacks. While Starmie, Butterfree, and Nidoqueen resist Fighting, Nidoqueen is weak to Poliwrath's other STAB, and Starmie and Butterfree can be OHKO'd by Dream Eater. Preventing Poliwrath from getting in safely and poisoning Starmie and Butterfree is key to defeating it, so aggressively exerting pressure is key.
  </p>
  <p>   
  <b>Charizard</b> is only a major threat to the team if it carries Swords Dance, which is rare, but something to keep an eye on. To beat SD Zard with this team, paralyzing it is an important step. While the team really struggles to switch into boosted Hyper Beams, at least once it's paralyzed Snorlax and Nidoqueen can pressure it. It's hard not to let it trade positively, but if it's paralyzed it shouldn't be able to sweep.   
  </p>
  <b>Disable</b> is something to look out for with any team. Ninetales and Tangela aren't too problematic, as the team has more than one switch-in to them, so depending on the team the less useful switch-in can come in and risk losing a key move, but against Muk the only practical switch-in is Nidoqueen. Even if Nidoqueen is disabled, however, the Pokemon which Nidoqueen is relied on to answer for, most pertinently Aerodactyl and Electric-types like Zapdos, can also be checked to a degree by its partners, so even with a good disable from Muk all is not lost.    
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, it is worth noting that against teams carrying <b>Muk</b>, keeping Starmie unparalyzed is crucial. This is because Muk can use Transform against incoming Nidoqueen, and it becomes extremely threatening if it does so, thanks to its mammoth base HP stat. An unparalyzed Starmie has no problem taking repeated hits from nidoqueen, and can retaliate with super-effective STAB moves, so having Starmie unparalyzed is crucial to ensure that Muk's Transform is not a losing proposition.
