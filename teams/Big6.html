		Starmie is running Blizzard + Thunderbolt. This set was chosen because it allows Starmie to hit Rhydon and Exeggutor hard with Blizzard and hit other opposing Waters hard with Thunderbolt. Chansey is this team's primary answer to Snorlax and special attackers. The standard Reflect set is chosen because of its ability to wall Snorlax and force it to Rest. Once Snorlax uses Rest, you can send out a Pokémon to pressure it, namely Exeggutor, but if your opponent is weak to Hypno, you can send it out on Snorlax Rest and start setting up. Exeggutor is this team's sole sleeper. It functions as an alternative special wall and Rhydon check. Mega Drain was chosen over other options because it hits Rhydon the hardest and helps Exeggutor's longetivity. If you get to low HP and can afford to lose Exeggutor, you can use Explosion and hopefully trade. Snorlax's job is to pressure anything paralyzed with its hard-hitting physical moves. Earthquake's job is to hit anything weak to Ground and to scout for Counter from opposing Pokémon. Tauros has a few purposes: revenge killing, pressuring sleeping Pokémon, and potential for late-game cleaning. Surf was chosen over Blizzard because it KOs Rhydon after a little bit of chip; Blizzard is still a viable choice, however. Hypno gains Amnesia from tradebacks, which turns it into a very threatening special sweeper who can single-handedly sweep if your opponent lacks options against it. Send it in when safe and set up Amnesia. Reflect mitigates its greatest weakness: being pressured by physical attackers while Resting.
