  This team is designed to be a typical team in the Dream Eater archetype. Only a handful of Pokemon have access to the move, and it's an extremely powerful one, 2HKOing most Pokemon even if they aren't weak to it, so long as they are affected by the move. Poliwrath, Gengar, and Hypno form an excellent and versatile core, making Dream Eater as difficult to evade as possible. Normal-types are immune to Dream Eater, but Poliwrath's Karate Chop makes light work of them, and Hypno's Submission lets it get past Chansey, albeit with the downside of a lot of recoil. Poison-types can't be poisoned, making them immune to Dream Eater if they don't take sleep, but Gengar resists their Poison-type STAB and sometimes their other moves as well, making it a great retaliatory answer, and Hypno has no problem getting through Poison-types with its Psychic-type STAB. Hypno's Psychic resistance is also extremely useful as Poliwrath and Gengar are both weak to it.

  Tangela is the most natural Disable user to pair with this core, as Ninetales and Muk have typing overlap with members of the Dream Eater core, its resistance to Ground-type attacks help shore the team up against Dugtrio, and Poison-types, which like switching into it, are great Disable targets for this team.

  Dragonite abuses Toxic for this team in other ways. Wrap synergises well with Toxic, allowing it to rack up damage on the opposing team, though Wrap's low PP doesn't make it an excellent strategy. However, it works excellently with Whirlwind. Against Pokemon Dragonite can scare out, Whirlwind can be used to rack up poison damage, and Wrap can prevent the opponent from healing it back up. It's also an excellent answer to opposing Dream Eater teams, since it can remove poison status from itself with Haze. Meanwhile, Magneton exists to serve a defensive purpose here, in particular helping to fend off a lot of dangerous Flying-types like Zapdos, Aerodactyl, and Pidgeot.
