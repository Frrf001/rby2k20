	Along with Jolteon, Gengar is probably the least-used viable lead in the current RBY metagame. He matches up relatively poorly against Alakazam (~26% of leads in SPL XI, ~29% in PPL 2020) and Starmie (~45% of leads in SPL XI, ~36% in PPL 2020), and his Hypnosis runs on a miserable 60% accuracy, meaning that you'll end up asleep with nothing to show for your troubles almost a third of the time you click Hypnosis against lead Jynx (18% of leads in SPL XI, 23% in PPL 2020) or Exeggutor (6% of leads in SPL XI, 4% in PPL 2020). Most people will tell you that the answer is to simply play Gengar in the back with a more conventional lead up front. This team goes the other direction and does everything it can to either mitigate lead Gengar's weaknesses or even convert them into strengths. PhysLax is used over ReflectLax because the Gengar/Zapdos package provides you with safe(-ish) switches against Tauros and answers to opposing ReflectLax (at least 40% of Laxes in SPL XI, 46% in PPL 2020) that a standard team wouldn't have. Mega Drain is used on both Exeggutor and Gengar for extra action against Rhydon (23% usage in SPL XI, 20% in PPL 2020) and Golem (negligible usage in SPL XI and PPL 2020). Sing is used on Chansey to capitalize on opposing lead Alakazam and Starmie, as Gengar is usually forced to switch out against these anyways.

  A common misconception is that the point of Gengar is to outspeed and sleep Jynx , which no other Pokemon in the game can do. In reality, this is only half the story. Going for Hypnosis against Jynx remains relevant against teams that have retained the old Jynx+Mie+Big 4 structure, but against those who have adopted Nails's cutting-edge Eggyless technology (roughly 64% of Jynx teams in SPL XI, 71% in PPL 2020), the better move is often to simply click Explosion (96% chance to OHKO including crits) for a near-guaranteed trade with the opposing Jynx and plop out your own Exeggutor with no fear of a troublesome speed tie. Alakazam and Starmie remain problematic, but are much less threatening to lead Gengar once you look at the current metagame and realize that you will often be switching to Chansey or occasionally even Exeggutor on turn 1 against these Pokemon regardless of the lead you have chosen (barring Jynx, of course). The main difference is that your Chansey will likely take a Psychic on the switch here as opposed to a Thunder Wave, but it will Sing back at the opposing Alakazam or Starmie all the same. Once this line of play is concluded and you're prepared to bridge into the midgame, the world is your oyster with both Gengar and Zapdos at your disposal. Run your PhysLax headfirst into their ReflectLax with no fear; just take an empty Body Slam or weak Ice Beam on the switch to Gengar, then hit back with Thunderbolts as you please. Switch Gengar into an opposing Tauros and take no damage from Body Slam, then pivot into an unrevealed Zapdos on the next turn to dodge the incoming Earthquake.

  If you've ever cursed at your computer screen after running a Body Slam into a fresh Cloyster for the fourth time in one night, this is the team for you. Cloyster (11% usage in SPL XI, 17% in PPL 2020) absolutely crumbles to Gengar and Zapdos, both of whom outspeed it and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt (22% OHKO with Gengar, 20% with Zapdos). Starmie (77% usage in SPL XI, 70% in PPL 2020) is a bit more tricky. A lead Starmie will outspeed and OHKO Gengar with Psychic almost a fifth of the time with a crit and an average damage roll. Starmies with Blizzard/Thunderbolt or Surf/Thunderbolt are less threatening but still problematic to Gengar, as he will have to wade through paralysis to land his Thunderbolts. Zapdos fares slightly better, surviving a crit Blizzard from Starmie (74.9-88.2% damage) and negating the speed drop from a Thunder Wave with Agility. In either case, you'll want to ensure that Starmie is asleep or paralyzed in the early game before bridging into a potential sweep with one of your heavy-hitting Thunderbolt machines. Once Starmie is paralyzed, it's a sitting duck for Zapdos, whose Thunderbolt (74.6-87.9% damage) cleanly 2HKOs through Recover without a crit, and doesn't fare much better against Gengar, who needs to grind through Recovers with his own Thunderbolt (51.0-60.0% damage) but will still OHKO with a crit, barring the absolute lowest damage rolls.

  While Gengar and Zapdos match up very well against common Water-type Pokemon like Starmie and Cloyster, they get rocked hard by Rhydon and Golem. Mega Drain on Exeggutor (2HKO on both with 37.6%-48.8% recovered for each hit) and Gengar (2HKO on both with 30.9%-40.2% recovered for each hit) help to shore up this weakness, but keep in mind that both can fire back at Gengar with Earthquake for a near-certain OHKO (100% of the time with Rhydon, 88.3% with Golem). At higher levels of play, Mega Drain works particularly nicely on Exeggutor with this team once you become confident enough to predict turn 1 switches to Chansey and capitalize by going to Exeggutor instead, which can often result in a sleeping Starmie that will be prone to stay in and take a surprise Drain (94% 3HKO with 13.2-15.5% recovered for each hit) where it would normally expect a much weaker Double-Edge at worst. Often it can be entirely acceptable to sacrifice Chansey to either Rock-type in the midgame in order to get off an Ice Beam that will virtually always leave either of them in kill range for Gengar's Mega Drain or Tauros's Blizzard. Jolteon threatens Zapdos and annoys Gengar, but struggles to switch in safely against PhysLax and usually can't get past Chansey without taking paralysis from Thunder Wave.
