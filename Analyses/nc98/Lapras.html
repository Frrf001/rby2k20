<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    It's very possible to use Thunderbolt and Thunder together; if used in sequence, it will always KO Starmie while Lapras can withstand two Thunderbolts from it. Sing can be used, but the 0-3 sleep turn duration makes the risk-reward factor very poor. Confuse Ray is also a possibility for messing with leads.
