<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Rock Slide can complement Earthquake for improved physical coverage. Blizzard can be used over Surf for a slightly improved Exeggutor matchup. Substitute can be used alongside Counter, as Counter ignores the presence of it and deals damage. Fissure can be used for a cheesy OHKO, which is helpful for forcing Kangaskhan's way through Chansey.
