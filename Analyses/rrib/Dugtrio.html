<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Dugtrio gained a bit of base attack in Rose Red/Iris Blue, but that's all it needs to become a scary end-game threat. Its blistering speed and potent Edgequake means that it can threaten most of the format once the opposition is worn down. Furthermore, its high crit rate can make switching into Dugtrio a daunting task. However, Dugtrio remains as frail as ever and cannot afford to trade for the most part. Its movepool is also sparse and its role is predictable. Then again... does that even matter against RBY's King of Crits?</p>

<h3>Cleaner</h3>

<p><set>
    Dugtrio <br>
    - Earthquake <br>
    - Rock Slide <br>
    - Slash <br>
    - Substitute <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Earthquake + Rock Slide makes for some great coverage, hitting the format for neutral damage or better. Slash is convenient for when you don't want to predict, and Substitute can give Dugtrio more opportunities to attack if an electric-type is forced out.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Body Slam can paralyze some switch-ins but it's often better to go for damage or fish for a critical hit. Hyper Beam is a bit stronger than Slash and has the chance to crit, but it's a lot more commital than Slash.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Status: Paralysis can destroy Dugtrio's main niche, and burn prevents it from meaningfully damaging things. Poison opens up Dream Eater counterplay.<br>
	Bulky water/grass types: If these are not sufficently worn down, Dugtrio will take immense damage or faint while attempting to muscle through the opponent.
