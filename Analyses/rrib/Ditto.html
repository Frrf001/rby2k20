<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Ditto is such a peculiar Pokemon in the first generation. It can transform into its foe, copying everything except the base HP, and gets 5 PP of each of the opponent's moves. With increased base HP and speed, Ditto is capable of pulling off a Transform more reliably now. Keeping its 25% critical rate even after transforming can make for some scary copies, especially of slower Pokemon that usually do not have good critical rates. It is currently unknown as to how viable Ditto will be in Rose Red/Iris Blue.</p>

    Ditto<br>
    - Transform <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>

<p>
    Transform into the opposing Pokemon, and go with the flow from there. Maybe you gained a status move, or a spammable STAB attack? Use whatever makes the most sense for the given situation. Be flexible, just like Ditto.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>
    None, because Ditto only learns Transform.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>
	Varying coverage: Some Pokemon happen to carry coverage that can hit themselves super effectively. Because Ditto's Transform will usually go first, it is possible that the opponent could use a coverage move to severely dent the copy while it is transforming.
