<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>True to its later evolution’s role, Electabuzz hits the gym and becomes an anti-meta electric type wallbreaker. Its new electric STAB in Thunder Punch is powerful on its own, but Electabuzz is a lot more than that now. Golem/Rhydon and Chansey are known as solid electric counters... but all of them get smashed by Electabuzz’ new secondary fighting typing. However, it should be noted that the rock/ground types are only 2hko'd by fighting moves and hitting Chansey will mean taking a lot of recoil. Additionally, common grass types like Tangela and Exeggutor are solid checks to Electabuzz. Furthermore, Buzz loses the classic electric type’s flying resistance to gain powerful fighting typing, and gains a psychic weakness. Regardless, Electabuzz brings a new dimension to electric types and is a welcome addition to the Rose Red/Iris Blue format.</p>
