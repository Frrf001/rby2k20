<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>With unique typing that grants it useful resistances and alleviates typical bad matchups for fire and dragon types, Charizard is a versatile attacker that can utilize a ton of different tools to break down the opposition. Access to an unresisted high base-power STAB in Hyper Fang can let Charizard play hit-and-run, or it can use Fire Spin trapping to bring in teammates while wearing down key threats. The threat of Swords Dance can also make special walls think twice before switching in. However, Charizard has to pick and choose its counterplay and it does suffer from some 4MSS. Middling offenses can also make its neutral damage matchups somewhat underwhelming at times, relying more on its set synergy to do its job. It is also very weak to status and must be protected. When supported and played well though, Charizard can be a menace to deal with.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Pivot</h3>

<p><set>
    Charizard <br>
    - Fire Blast <br>
    - Fire Spin <br>
    - Hyper Fang <br>
    - Slash <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Fire Spin allows Charizard to lock down switch-ins and bring in punishing teammates safely. Hyper Fang is a vicious STAB with equally strong drawbacks, so it should be used primarily as a finisher when Fire Spin weakens slower Pokemon into range. Slash is good for generalist damage against a lot of the format.
</p>
 
<h3>Swords Dance</h3>

<p><set>
    Charizard <br>
    - Hyper Fang <br>
    - Swords Dance <br>
    - Earthquake <br>
    - Hyper Beam <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Swords Dance Charizard can immediately rip through special walls that are looking to tank a potential Hyper Fang. Earthquake can hit the likes of GolDon, Omastar, and Nidoqueen hard after a boost, and Hyper Beam is a strong complimentary attack that can rip through many walls like Chansey and Clefable. If the grass and bug type matchups are important, then Fire Blast can be used instead of Hyper Fang.
</p>
 
<h3>All-out-Attacker</h3>

<p><set>
    Charizard <br>
    - Fire Blast <br>
    - Hyper Fang<br>
    - Earthquake <br>
    - Submission <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    4 attacks Charizard can immediately threaten much of the tier without needing a turn or a forced switch to be threatening. Earthquake hits many Charizard checks hard, and Submission can threaten normal-type walls. Slash can be used for more general coverage if desired.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Thrash is a more committal dragon STAB but doesn't incur a huge special drop, making it ideal for Charizard sets that want to clean up. Ember can guaranteed spread burns, and Toxic can support Dream Eater teammates. Body Slam can spread paralysis, but it's often better to go for more immediate damage with Charizard.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Charizard can actually be pretty difficult to hard counter, but it's a lot easier to check it.<br>
    Rock and ground types: Healthy rock or ground types can take on Charizard's coverage and retaliate with strong super-effective STABs.<br>
	Paralysis: Status cripples Charizard significantly, preventing it from effectively breaking down teams and making it easier to answer.<br>
