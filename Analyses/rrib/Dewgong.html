<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Dewgong is one of the most straightforward Pokemon in Rose Red/Iris Blue. With a new tool in Amnesia, Dewgong's otherwise barren movepool is suddenly strong enough to give it a niche as an ice-type bulky setup sweeper. +2 Blizzards will hurt and can eventually overpower the strongest of special walls, and Dewgong's 70 base speed is great for this role. However, Dewgong is exceedingly predictable and it will be a target for all sorts of status and attacks. Dewgong is also not particularly threatening without an Amnesia boost, so a lot of Pokemon may opt to trade with it before Dewgong can get out of hand. Dewgong counterplay also tends to overlap with most bulky water types and other Amnesia sweepers, so it is amply prepared for. Make no mistake; a disrespected Dewgong will blow an entire team away when given enough time.</p>

<h1>Sets</h1>

<h3>Amnesia Sweeper</h3>

<p><set>
    Dewgong<br>
    - Amnesia <br>
    - Blizzard <br>
    - Surf <br>
    - Rest <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>

<p>
    Double your special wih Amnesia when the electric-type attackers are down, and hit as many things as possible with high base-power Blizzards. Surf gives a consistent alternative STAB that can be used to bring checks down into Blizzard range. Rest gives Dewgong longevity especially as it boosts its special.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>
    Body Slam can spread paralysis but it's better to just boost up and hit things. Toxic could help Dream Eater teammates but seriously, just use Dewgong as your win condition instead.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>
	Starmie: This gets a special mention. Resisting Dewgong's dual STAB and having a high chance to crit through special boosts with Thunderbolt makes for an extremely hard Dewgong counter.<br>
    Bulky water types: These can switch into Dewgong's dual STAB comfortably and attempt to trade with Dewgong or status it.<br>
	Fighting types: The likes of Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Primeape, and more can deal a ton of damage with fighting STAB attacks.<br>
	Electric attacks: Electric coverage can cleanly 2hko or even ohko Dewgong. Fast electric types also have high critical rates that can ignore Amnesia boosts.
