<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Well... it’s still Chansey. It didn’t receive any buffs, and a lot more of the metagame can really hurt it by exploiting its weaker physical bulk. Chansey has also received some competition from other bulky normal types or recovery walls in general. So where does this all put Chansey? It’s still one of the premier walls of the metagame, doing the usual BoltBeam or Reflect sets. Toxic may find a moveslot on dream eater teams looking to use Chansey to wall psychic types, so it may find slightly more diversity in its sets. However, Chansey is nowhere near as omnipresent as it was in traditional RBY, and should not even be considered close to mandatory on teams.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>BoltBeam</h3>

<p><set>
    Chansey<br>
    - Ice Beam <br>
    - Soft-Boiled <br>
    - Thunder Wave<br>
	- Thunderbolt<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    A timeless and straightforward set, Chansey walls special attackers with astronomical Special bulk while spreading paralysis when possible. BoltBeam attacks hit the format for neutral damage.
</p>

<h3>Reflect</h3>

<p><set>
    Chansey<br>
    - Seismic Toss<br>
    - Soft-Boiled<br>
    - Thunder Wave<br>
    - Reflect<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    This is quite possibly as passive as you can get in gen 1, but the set still works the same. Set up Reflect to wall even more threats, and then harass the opposition with paralysis or guaranteed Seismic Toss damage.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Sing can catch some paralysis absorbers by surprise, putting them to sleep when they least expect it. Counter can punish normal type wallbreakers, but the increased effiacy of other physical attack types makes this less useful.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Fighting types: Strong fighting type attackers like Primeape, Machamp, and Poliwrath can rip through all of Chansey's bulk in one clean hit. Karate Chop users can even ignore Reflect boosts via critical hits.<br>
	Submission coverage: The buffed Submission can allow many Pokemon to at least 2hko Chansey at the cost of a lot of recoil.<br>
	Offensive normal types: Threats like Snorlax and Arcanine can muscle through Chansey's weaker physical bulk.<br>
	Flying types: Whirlwind mixed attackers can put a lot of pressure on Chansey.<br>
	Swords Dance sweepers: The likes of Scyther and Kabutops can demolish Chansey after a Swords Dance.<br>
	Sleep inducers: Putting Chansey to sleep can make it prey to a lot of wallbreakers.<br>
	Explosion and Self-Destruct: These can put Chansey in range of other attackers, or just outright remove it.<br>
