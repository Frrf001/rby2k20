<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>The buffs to flying-type attacks make Articuno one of the strongest mixed attackers in the format. The strongest Blizzard together with a powerful Whirlwind will make the likes of Chansey crumble, and even a paralyxed Starmie will now fear a potential 3hko. However, the buffs to many water, fire and electric types will keep Articuno in line. It is very important to keep Articuno and other flying types in mind when building a team, as its power should be respected now.</p>

<h3>Mixed Wallbreaker</h3>

<p><set>
    Articuno<br>
    - Blizzard <br>
    - Whirlwind <br>
    - Agility <br>
    - Razor Wind <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Blizzard and Whirlwind have very good synergy together, hitting most of each other's checks for big damage. Agility can ignore paralysis speed drops and Razor Wind is useful for Reflect users, or avoiding a chance to miss.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
   Ice Beam can be used instead of Razor Wind as a backup STAB. Reflect is useful on Articuno to improve physical matchups. Toxic can support Dream Eater users, notably luring Starmie.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Raichu: Resists both STABs and can threaten Articuno out with paralysis or electric attacks.<br>
    Bulky water types: The likes of Starmie, Omastar, Cloyster, and Lapras can all repeatedly check Articuno. If Starmie is paralyzed however, it becomes a shakier check.<br>
	Rock Slide: Faster threats like Aerodactyl and Primeape can destroy Articuno with Rock Slide. Slower Rock Slide users could hit Articuno on the switch or if it's paralyzed.<br>
