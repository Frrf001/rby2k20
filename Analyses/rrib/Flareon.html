<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Flareon’s increased bulk and newfound access to Explosion makes it a master of trading with the opponent. Many typical fire resists like rock/ground types can find themselves getting worn down by its strong Fire Blast, or water types can get outright destroyed by a powerful Explosion coming off of 130 base attack. It still struggles hard with water/rock types like most fire types do, but supporting that matchup isn’t hard for Flareon to freely blast teams apart. Flareon is also slow, meaning that its Fire Spin is most effective after extensive Paralysis support is given. Overall, Flareon is great for teams that want to break down the opposition quickly and is a fine teammate on offensive teams.

<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Volatile Breaker</h3>

<p><set>
    Flareon <br>
    - Fire Blast <br>
    - Fire Spin <br>
    - Hyper Beam <br>
    - Explosion <br> 
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Fire Spin can be used to halt switch-ins and allow a teammate to switch in safely, or it can be used to wear down a slower opponent into Fire Blast or Hyper Beam range. Explosion can be used to take a foe with it once Flareon's usefulness is done.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Body Slam is a decent option if spreading Paralysis with Flareon itself is desired, and Body Slam will hit hard off of 130 base attack. Flareon could use Rest if a bulky set is desired, but Flareon is better off being a fast-paced offensive menace. Toxic can be used to enable Dream Eater teammates. Ember can guarantee a burn but Body Slam Paralysis or Toxic spread is usually more desirable.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Rock types: Golem, Rhydon, Onix, and Omastar can all shrug off Flareon's attacks comfortably, even its strong Explosion, and retaliate with dangerous STABs.<br>
	Water types: The likes of Starmie and Raichu can tank Flareon's attacks, but they need to be wary of Explosion.<br>
	Ground types: While many ground types may not switch in too comfortably, they can threaten a lot of damage with Earthquake.
