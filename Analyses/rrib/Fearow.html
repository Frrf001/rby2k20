<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>With access to Slash and Razor Wind, Fearow is now able to be a critical-based attacker like it was intended to be in later generations (but failed miserably). The addition of Hypnosis to Fearow's learnset mirrors Pidgeot's new access to Sing, and provides Fearow with another option to break down flying resists. However, Fearow's movepool is sparse and it is straightforward to play against. Fearow is also rather frail so it is difficult to safely get it into play. That being said, Fearow still has good potential to be a wallbreaker that can quickly pressure the opponent when given the chance.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Offensive Sleeper</h3>

<p><set>
    Fearow <br>
    - Hypnosis<br>
    - Slash<br>
    - Whirlwind<br>
    - Razor Wind<br> 
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Slash off of base 90 attack is very powerful, making it a go-to move once the opponent has a sleeping Pokemon. Whirlwind can hit ghost types hard, and bulky normal checks like Exeggutor even harder. Razor Wind can ignore opposing Reflect boosts and has better accuracy than Whirlwind.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Agility can ignore Paralysis speed drops but it is difficult to fit onto a set. Toxic can support Dream Eater teammates.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Rock/ground types: The likes of Rhydon, Golem, and Onix can resist Fearow's dual STAB and threaten back with Rock Slide. They should be wary of Hypnosis, however.<br>
	Faster attackers: Fearow is easy to 2hko, so faster attackers like Starmie or Tauros can threaten to beat it.<br>
	Status: Fearow is frail, so absorbing Paralysis or Sleep will make it an easy target.
