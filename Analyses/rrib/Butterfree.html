<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Butterfree is one of the most influential Pokemon in the Rose Red/Iris Blue metagame. Its typing is very useful offensively as it is unresisted, and defensively as it can strongly check opposing psychic and fighting types. Access to dual powders and being able to force out so many RBY staples makes Butterfree quite the annoying bug once it enters the field. The increased viability of fire and flying types ensures that Butterfree is kept in check, and Butterfree is often an absorber of status so it can be susceptible to wallbreakers at times. Regardless, Butterfree is quite the threat and is one of the most anti-"standard RBY" checks in the format.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Dual powders make good use of all the forced switches that Butterfree will make. Leech Life provides Butterfree with some longevity and can condition the opponent into predictably switching bug resists in. Psychic is a powerful STAB that every psychic type should use.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Mega Drain can lure and remove GolDon more quickly. Whirlwind and Razor Wind could do significant damage to Parasect, but it's a very specific lure. Toxic could help spread poison for Dream Eater teams to capitalize on later.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Flying types: Flying types can deny meaningful amounts of Leech Life healing and threaten out Butterfree with high-powered STABs. Notably, the legendary birds and Pidgeot can even shrug off a Psychic. None of them like switching into dual powders, though.<br>
	Fire types: Fire types can also resist Leech Life and scare out Butterfree with a strong Fire Blast. Psychic and dual powders are not appreciated to switch into, however.<br>
	Parasect: Doesn't really mind switching into powders and it can out-heal Butterfree or get off a Spore, but a Psychic special drop can make things dicey.
