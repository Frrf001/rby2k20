<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>The PP nerfs to Wrap may seem to have hurt Dragonite, but it was more than compensated with powerful STAB attacks. This changes Dragonite's role in the metagame, as it is now a powerful threat outright as opposed to endlessly spamming Wrap until the opponents are chipped enough. The rise of bug and fighting types also makes Dragonite a better check to other Pokemon, instead of being a self-serving sweeper. Overall, Dragonite is a more fun addition to the metagame that can contribute towards its team earlier on in the game, while also promoting more creativity in exploring its deep movepool.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>

<h3>Offensive Utility</h3>

<p><set>
    Dragonite <br>
    - Razor Wind <br>
	- Hyper Fang <br>
    - Thunder Wave <br>
    - Wrap <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Dragonite's effectiveness depends on a player's ability to condition the opponent. Hyper Fang is a powerful STAB move that forces special tanks to switch in. Razor Wind and Wrap can capitalize on this and force physical tanks to switch in, leaving the opponent in a tough spot to choose between what to switch in against Dragonite. Thunder Wave can alleviate prediction by crippling most Pokemon, while also supporting other teammates or itself by letting Dragonite use Wrap against otherwise faster targets.

<h3>AgiWrap</h3>

<p><set>
    Dragonite <br>
    - Wrap <br>
    - Hyper Beam <br>
    - Blizzard<br>
    - Agility <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Paralyzing Dragonite is a common way to prevent Wrap from doing too much work. Agility circumvents this by ignoring paralysis speed drops. Hyper Beam is a great finisher once the opponent is worn down sufficiently, and Blizzard can hit normal resists like GolDon really hard. The low PP count of Wrap enforces an AgiWrap Dragonite to be well-supported, instead of solely relying on its own Wrap to chip counterplay into range.

<h3>Toxic Abuser</h3>

<p><set>
    Dragonite <br>
    - Wrap <br>
    - Razor Wind <br>
    - Blizzard<br>
    - Toxic <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Toxic and Wrap synergize well together, with each turn of trapping also triggering poison damage. Razor Wind can finish off physically frail switch-ins like Chansey and Gengar, while Blizzard hits rock/ground types that aim to absorb flying STAB or Wraps. This Dragonite set is great on teams that aim to spread poison status, so Dream Eater abusers make for great teammates.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Surf does a lot more damage to GolDon than Blizzard or Hyper Fang. Thunderbolt can heavily pressure bulky water types, like Cloyster and Starmie. Body Slam can spread paralysis while doing damage, but its low base power and lack of STAB makes it unappealing.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Ice coverage: Blizzard or Ice Beam from just about anything will annihilate Dragonite.<br>
	Paralysis: A paralyzed Dragonite is easy to check, as Wrap trapping becomes inconsistent and just about anything will outspeed it.<br>
	PP stalling: Each time Wrap is used, switching out will force Wrap to consume another PP. It only has 8 PP but be careful not to switch out during the last Wrap (1 PP remaining). Otherwise, it will roll over to 63 PP.
