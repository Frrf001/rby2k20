<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Alakazam remains a strong pick in Rose Red/Iris Blue, with its great 120 speed and 135 special allowing it to be a powerhouse while still having good utility options. However, a lot of competition has caught up to it. The buffs to bug type Pokemon and attacks make absorbing Paralysis a risky task for Alakazam, and the rise of Dream Eater teams makes brainlessly absorbing sleep or poison dangerous as well. Furthermore, many special attackers gained strong mixed offensive tools, notably flying-type attackers like Moltres and Articuno, that can prey on Alakazam's weak physical bulk. In short, Alakazam is still a strong pick but now it can't be used as brainlessly as standard RBY.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Offensive Utility</h3>

<p><set>
    Alakazam <br>
    - Psychic <br>
    - Recover <br>
    - Thunder Wave <br>
    - Seismic Toss <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Some things never change, and Alakazam's strengths are certainly one of them. Spread paralysis with the threat of a Psychic backed by powerful 135 special, and use Seismic Toss against opposing psychic types that resist your attacks.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Reflect can be used to try tanking physical hits and weaker explosions. Counter can catch a normal-type attacker by surprise, but the rise of other physical attacking types makes this less useful.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Butterfree: The dedicated anti-psychic Pokemon can comfortably switch into Alakazam, threaten sleep or paralysis, and heal off damage with Leech Life.<br>
	Bug-type attackers: From speed demons like Beedrill to bulky tanks like Parasect, many physical bug types can scare off Alakazam.<br>
	Bulky physical attackers: If Alakazam is paralyzed, then bulky attackers like Snorlax can threaten a lot of damage.<br>
	Dream Eater: A poisoned or sleeping Alakazam is now susceptible to getting hit by a 180 bp ghost-type attack.
