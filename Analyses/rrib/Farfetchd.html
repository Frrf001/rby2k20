<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Items don't exist in gen 1 so Farfetch’d retains its love for the mighty sticc through a new grass primary typing. The combination of Flying and Grass could be tough for teams that rely on slow rock/ground types to check birds, and electric attacks are now neutral against this flying type attacker. However, a horrendous quad weakness to ice and weaknesses to many other common attacking types really hurts the viability of Farfetch’d in the meta. Its low bulk does it no favors either, meaning even neutral hits from normal and psychic types will hurt. Overall Farfetch’d is probably an underdog pick, albeit a usable one. Perhaps its greatest value when adding it to a team is the mental damage it causes your opponent, knowing they might lose to a Farfetch’d.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    After a Swords Dance, Farfetch'd can hit quite hard with a 110 base power STAB in Whirlwind. Razor Leaf denies ground types from walling Farfetch'd, and Hyper Beam can blow past some electric types after a boost.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Agility can allow Farfetch'd to ignore Paralysis speed drops, but adding it requires a sacrifice to coverage options.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Ice coverage: Just about any Ice Beam or Blizzard will put an end to Farfetch'd.<br>
	Opposing flying types: With their natural bulk and powerful STABs, other flying types will easily 1v1 Farfetch'd. Special mention goes to Zapdos for resisting Flying and Grass.<br>
	Fire types: Unless they are paralyzed, the likes of Arcanine and Ninetales can outspeed and scare away Farfetch'd with a powerful Fire Blast.<br>
	Normal types: Farfetch'd has poor defense, so strong normal type attackers like Tauros and Persian can beat it 1v1.
