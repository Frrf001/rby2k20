<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Aerodactyl is a great end-game cleaner with solid dual STAB, solid offensive stats, blazing 130 base speed, and a scary 25.4% crit rate. It also boasts useful typing against the common normal and ground attacks. However, Aerodactyl lacks a powerful burst damage option like Tauros' STAB Hyper Beam. This means that Aerodactyl relies more on forced switches and critical hits to muscle through its counterplay. Aerodactyl is also weak to common coverage moves like rock, ice, and electric attacks. Despite these drawbacks, Aerodactyl is one of the scariest Pokemon to switch into in the format when its checks and counters are worn down in the end-game.</p>

<h3>Cleaner</h3>

<p><set>
    Aerodactyl<br>
    - Wing Attack<br>
    - Rock Slide<br>
    - Hyper Beam<br>
    - Razor Wind<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Wing Attack and Rock Slide are basic STAB moves that hit most of the metagame at least neutrally. Hyper Beam is a bit stronger than its STABs so it can finish off threats in a pinch. Razor Wind can be used to ignore Reflect boosts and prevent them from walling Aerodactyl. It is important to use the threat of Aerodactyl's speed to force switches, as a lot of Aerodactyl's strength comes from the threat of critical hits and potential 2hko's on the switch.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Fire Blast can burn GolDon on the switch, making them easier to switch into. Agility can be used to circumvent paralysis speed drops. Aerodactyl can also utilize Reflect itself, though it isn't advised because of the many special weaknesses that Aerodactyl has.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Golem/Rhydon/Onix: These all resist Aerodactyl's dual STAB and coverage options. Fire Blast burns are not appreciated, however.<br>
	Starmie: Avoids the 2hko from Aerodactyl's STABs and can threaten a Thunder Wave or BoltBeam attack.<br>
	Nidoqueen: Its high physical bulk can heal off Aerodactyl's physical attacks and threaten a Blizzard in response.<br>
	Omastar: Can heal through Aerodactyl's dual STAB and use powerful water or ice attacks.<br>
	Clefable: Its good overall bulk can let it heal through Aerodactyl's attacks and threaten a Thunder Wave or BoltBeam in response.<br>
	Bulky attackers: Bulky offensive threats like Slowbro, Tauros, Snorlax, etc. can threaten to trade with Aerodactyl if they aren't weakened enough.
