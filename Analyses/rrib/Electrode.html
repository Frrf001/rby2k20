<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Electrode pretty much spammed Thunder Wave, 27.5% crit rate electric STAB, and clicked Explosion when it was done. It will do the same thing in Rose Red/Iris Blue, albeit the speed is more cherished because it outspeeds Aerodactyl. Normal typing gives STAB to Explosion and Hyper beam, which lets it break some electric checks more effectively. However, Electrode still gets walled by the same old threats in golDon and Gengar, but Electrode is otherwise a threat to most Pokemon that do not resist normal.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Offensive</h3>

<p><set>
    Electrode <br>
    - Thunderbolt <br>
    - Thunder Wave <br>
    - Hyper Beam <br>
    - Explosion <br> 
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    This is extremely straightforward. Use Thunderbolt and Hyper Beam to clean when the electric checks are weakened down, or eliminate an electric check yourself with Explosion. Thunder Wave can be used to paralyze opposing threats in a pinch.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Thunder can be used if the extra boost in power is desired, but the lack of accuracy is undesirable. Screech can make Hyper Beam more threatening against some electric checks, but it's hard to fit onto a set. Toxic can be used instead of Thunder Wave to enable Dream Eater teammates.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Rock/Ground types: The likes of Golem, Rhydon, and Onix are sturdy counters to Electrode's dual STAB.<br>
	Grass types: The likes of Exeggutor and Tangela are very bulky, forcing Electrode to explode if it wishes to get past them.<br>
	Status: Electrode's biggest niche is its blistering speed. Paralysis kills this and Electrode does not have the bulk to be a good sleep absorber.
