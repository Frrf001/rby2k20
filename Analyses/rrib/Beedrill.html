<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>With buffed offenses and actual STABs alongside a new way to abuse poison, Beedrill is a high-potential sweeper on Dream Eater teams. With blazing speed that outpaces all psychic types and poison-spreading STABs, Beedrill is the perfect fit for teams that want to spread poison fast and abuse Dream Eater. However, Beedrill is painfully frail and is forced to be played in the mid to late-game. With the right support though, this new glass-cannon Beedrill can rip teams apart when given the chance.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Beedrill is straightforward in what it does. It uses its dual STAB to spread poison and chip things down, and then clean up with Dream Eater in the late-game. Swords Dance can capitalize on a forced switch and destroy switch-ins when given the chance, especially if they are poisoned.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Hyper Beam can be used in place of a STAB to do more burst damage to normal or poison type walls after a Swords Dance. Agility can ignore paralysis boosts but it's really difficult to fit onto a set.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Nidoqueen: Generally a big threat to Dream Eater teams, Nidoqueen is immune to getting poisoned and resists Beedrill's dual STAB. Even a +2 Hyper Beam won't do much to it. <br>
	Bulky poison types: Other bulky poison types like Gengar and Weezing can give Beedrill some trouble, as they are immune to opposing Dream Eater attacks.<br>
	GolDon: The iconic rock/ground duo don't fear Beedrill's dual STAB at all. Poison damage can rack up though, and eventually a +2 Dream Eater could be enough to do them in.
