<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Exeggutor’s amazing stat spread, access to dual powders, reliable psychic STAB, and Explosion made it a fantastic mixed bag of options to throw onto many traditional RBY teams. In Rose Red/Iris Blue... it’s still Exeggutor. The increased prevalence of fighting, rock, electric, and ground types make it all the more valuable. However, the rise of flying, bug, and fire types means that it cannot be slapped onto teams as carelessly as before and must actually be supported with reliable teammates. Overall, Exeggutor is a fine metagame staple that offers a lot of role compression to many teams.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Exeggutor's strong offenses and solid bulk means that it will find many opportunities to use Sleep Powder. Explosion allows Exeggutor to take down a foe with it when its usefulness is done. Mega Drain is now a reliable source of healing and lets Exeggutor pressure bulky water types like Starmie.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Stun Spore can cripple the faster psychic types that like to switch in against Exeggutor. Double-Edge can let Exeggutor punish Psychic types more directly if they attempt to absorb a Sleep Powder, by exploiting their lower defense stat. Exeggutor is a great spreader of Toxic, as its powerful Psychic can dissuade poison types from staying in.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Bug types: A Leech Life, Vise Grip, or Bind from these will deal immense damage to Exeggutor. Butterfree gets a special mention for resisting Exeggutor's dual STAB and threatening with its own dual powders or STABs.<br>
    Flying types: With their high base power STAB attacks, most flying types pose a big threat to Exeggutor.<br>
	Fire types: The likes of Arcanine and Moltres can force Exeggutor out with the threat of a powerful Fire Blast. Special mention goes to Ninetales for resisting Exeggutor's dual STAB.<br>
	Ice coverage: Blizzard and Ice Beam are very common coverage moves in RRIB, which can worsen Exeggutor's matchups against some threats like Starmie and Tauros.
