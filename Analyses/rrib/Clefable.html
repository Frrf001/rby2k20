<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>With the re-introduction of Soft-Boiled on Clefable, the ORAS queen is back with its annoying combination of bulk, power, and versatility. Having a wide offensive and defensive movepool allows Clefable to be splashable, creative, and useful to a variety of teams and archetypes. However, a lot of Chansey's counterplay tends to overlap with Clefable, and Chansey is strongly prepped for by most teams. Despite this, Clefable remains a strong pick in the Rose Red/Iris Blue metagame.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Paralysis Spread</h3>

<p><set>
    Clefable<br>
    - Body Slam <br>
    - Soft-Boiled <br>
    - Thunder Wave<br>
	- Ice Beam<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    The combination of Body Slam and Thunder Wave ensures that paralysis will be spread quickly against the opposing team. Ice Beam prevents some normal resists like GolDon from coming in for free. If Omastar, Cloyster, and other bulky water types are a threat then Thunderbolt can be used instead.
</p>

<h3>Reflect</h3>

<p><set>
    Clefable<br>
    - Seismic Toss<br>
    - Soft-Boiled<br>
    - Thunder Wave<br>
    - Reflect<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Similar to Chansey, Clefable can become a potent physical wall when using Reflect in tandem with Soft-Boiled for healing. Seismic Toss and Thunder Wave can be replaced with any attacks or utility moves to hit key threats for Clefable's teammates.
</p>

<h3>Physical Attacker</h3>

<p><set>
    Clefable<br>
    - Body Slam<br>
    - Soft-Boiled<br>
    - Hyper Beam<br>
    - Blizzard<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Hyper Beam Clefable can close out some paralyzed Pokemon with surprise burst damage. Since this set is more aggressive, Blizzard makes Clefable more immediately threatening at the cost of PP.
</p>

<h3>Surprise!</h3>

<p><set>
    Clefable<br>
    - Ice Beam<br>
    - Soft-Boiled<br>
    - Counter<br>
    - Sing<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Clefable can go for more explosive utility in fast-paced matchups. Sing can put something to sleep by surprise, and Counter can quickly remove a normal type attacker.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Submission could be used to break opposing normal types faster, but it's often not necessary because of Clefable's solid bulk and power. Tri Attack could do more damage to opposing psychic types but it is a very specific tech.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Fighting types: Strong fighting type attackers can pressure Clefable out with the threat of super-effective damage.<br>
	Submission coverage: The buffed Submission can allow many Pokemon to threaten Clefable.<br>
	Bulky psychic types: Repeated Psychic special drops can force out Clefable, especially if it isn't bringing any physical attacks to retaliate.<br>
	Sleep inducers: Putting Clefable to sleep can make it prey to a lot of wallbreakers.<br>
	Explosion and Self-Destruct: These can put Clefable in range of other attackers, or just outright remove it.
