<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Arbok is a powerful abuser of paralysis spread and can punish conventional paralysis absorbers very hard. Through defense drops, paralysis, and partial trapping, Arbok is a specialist at locking down slow teams and picking them apart. However, Arbok tends to struggle against healthy offensive teams so it requires significant paralysis support against them. In exchange for this required support however, Arbok can be a very powerful mid to end-game presence.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Trapper</h3>

<p><set>
    Arbok <br>
    - Acid <br>
    - Earthquake <br>
    - Glare <br>
    - Wrap <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Glare should be used whenever possible to start spreading paralysis. Later on, Acid could be used to drop the foe's defense and open up more Wrap damage. Earthquake hits Wrap resists like GolDon. The combination of Acid with Wrap or Earthquake can assist in breaking down Arbok checks, so carefully consider which move is the best in the given situation.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Mega Drain can hit GolDon slightly harder and heal a lot of health, in exchange for losing Earthquake's synergy with Acid. Rock Slide can hit flying types and especially Aerodactyl, which resists the rest of Arbok's kit.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Aerodactyl: Resists everything except the rare Rock Slide Arbok. Needs to be wary of Glare, however.<br>
	Rock types: Typically have the bulk to handle Earthquake coverage, but need to be wary of Acid defense drops and paralysis.<br>
    Faster psychic types: Pokemon like Starmie and Alakazam will threaten big damage or paralysis against Arbok. However they need to be wary of Glare or being paralyzed by other teammates.<br>
	Paralysis: A paralyzed Arbok means that it will greatly struggle to do its job of outspeeding and trapping.
