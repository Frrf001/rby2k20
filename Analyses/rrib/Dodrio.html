<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>With Snorlax-level attack and a great base 100 speed, Dodrio has the tools necessary to be a threatening fast attacker. Unresisted ghost and fighting coverage together can really put the hurt on conventional flying-type counterplay, and a good critical rate makes switching into Dodrio a daunting task. Unfortunately, Dodrio is frail and difficult to get onto the field safely. Its typing doesn't offer many useful resistances and leaves it with weaknesses to common coverage types. Playing Dodrio evasively is key; get your damage and run away early on, then later finish off the worn-down targets.</p>

<h1>Sets</h1>

<h3>All-out-Attacker</h3>

<p><set>
    Dodrio<br>
    - Whirlwind <br>
	- Body Slam <br>
	- Hyper Beam <br>
	- Jump Kick <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>

<p>
    Dodrio's widely abusable dual STAB hits like a truck. Whirlwind and Body Slam are great early-game attacks that can wear down the foe into Hyper Beam range. Jump Kick is strong coverage for rock types that are looking to freely switch in. 
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>
    Tri Attack can hit some psychic types super effectively and is a more accurate way of hitting ghost types like Golduck. Agility can ignore paralysis speed drops but it's hard to fit onto a set. Toxic can enable Dream Eater teammates more quickly.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>
	Healthy rock types: These can tank Jump Kicks in a pinch and threaten Dodrio with rock STAB.<br>
	Status: Paralysis greatly cripples Dodrio and prevents it from breaking effectively, while also slowing it down for opposing attackers to prey on.
