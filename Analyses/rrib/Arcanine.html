<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>If one were to take the premise behind Fire Blast Tauros and slap dual STAB on it, they'd get Rose Red/Iris Blue's Arcanine. Arcanine's sparse, normal-infested movepool becomes its blessing as it gains very powerful normal STAB off of its very high 110 attack. Despite this, its movepool is unchanged and being a fire type with no Fire Spin is a bit of a let-down. It doesn't have the wide coverage of other normal types, but it certainly has the raw power to be a solid wallbreaker and potential end-game win condition.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Mixed Wallbreaker</h3>

<p><set>
    Arcanine<br>
    - Fire Blast <br>
    - Body Slam <br>
    - Hyper Beam <br>
    - Agility <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    STAB attacks and a utility move. Arcanine doesn't have a whole lot else it can use, but those first 3 attacks hit most of the tier like a truck. Agility can be used to ignore paralysis and sweep in the end-game if the Arcanine checks are weakened enough.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
   Reflect can help take on opposing normal types even better. Ember can guaranteed burn foes if you want to spread burn more quickly. Toxic can support Dream Eater users if Arcanine is on a Dream Eater team.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
	Rock types: Golem, Rhydon, Onix are examples of Pokemon that can resist Arcanine's dual STAB and threaten their own STAB back.<br>
	Bulky water types: Starmie, Omastar, and other bulky water types can diffuse Arcanine's power. Body Slam paralysis can be a problem for speed-reliant water types, however.<br>
	Earthquake users: Faster earthquake users like Tauros and Dugtrio can threaten Arcanine out. They struggle to switch in safely though.
