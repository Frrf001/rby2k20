<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Cloyster didn't change that much, but it appreciates an accuracy buff to Clamp and an anti-psychic coverage move in Tri Attack. This makes Cloyster more consistent and less easily walled by some previous hard counters, notably Starmie. It still has middling offenses and it doesn't appreciate the significant buffs to bug and grass types, but it has more of a niche by being able to confront so many flying types comfortably. There is also more competition it has to contest as a bulky water type. Overall, Cloyster is about as good as it was before and its all-rounded role is useful when supported.</p>

<h1>Sets</h1>

<h3>Standard</h3>

<p><set>
    Cloyster<br>
    - Clamp <br>
    - Blizzard <br>
    - Explosion <br>
    - Tri Attack <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>

<p>
    Clamp can halt switch-ins and chip them down for teammates, while Blizzard is a very powerful STAB. Tri Attack is a neat anti-psychic tool that can put pressure on paralyzed psychic types like Alakazam and Starmie. Explosion can remove something in a pinch or when Cloyster has already done its job.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>
    Rest can give Cloyster some more longevity, and Hyper Beam can act as a finisher after using Clamp trapping.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>
    Bulky water types: These can switch into Cloyster's dual STAB comfortably, though Starmie needs to watch out for Tri Attack now.<br>
	Fighting types: Even with Cloyster's sky-high defense, fighting type attackers can threaten to 2hko Cloyster.<br>
	Electric attacks: Electric coverage can cleanly 2hko or even ohko Cloyster.<br>
	Special walls: These can absorb Clamp and pp stall it quickly, but these walls also need to watch for Explosion.
