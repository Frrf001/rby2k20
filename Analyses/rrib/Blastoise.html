<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>With a simple type change, Blastoise goes from an outclassed mono water to a unique, no-nonsense offensive tank with useful typing. Notably, Blastoise can take on the BoltBeam combo easily thanks to its new immunity to Electric. Its high bulk will even allow its Substitute to not be broken by some BoltBeam attacks, which allows Blastoise to comfortably throw out attacks. Despite all this going for it, Blastoise isn't without its flaws. Its neutral damage output is underwhelming at times and it can get worn down fast.</p>
 
<h1>Sets</h1>
 
<h3>Offensive Tank</h3>

<p><set>
    Blastoise<br>
    - Hydro Pump<br>
    - Earthquake<br>
    - Blizzard<br>
    - Substitute<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    This set aims to punish passive BoltBeam users by having their attacks fail to break a Substitute. Earthquake and Hydro Pump are strong STABs, and Blizzard hits the grass types that try to resist this combination.
</p>

<h3>Reflect Tank</h3>

<p><set>
    Blastoise<br>
    - Ice Beam<br>
    - Earthquake<br>
    - Reflect<br>
    - Rest<br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    Blastoise can use a set like this for more longevity. Ice/ground attacks are unresisted, and repeated Ice Beams can force out opposing Reflect users.
</p>
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Surf doesn't miss, but reducing Blastoise's neutral damage output further is generally not advised. Submission can lure walls like Clefable and Chansey. Body Slam can be used on Reflect sets to spread paralysis instead of freeze, but its damage output is relatively low.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    High-bst wallbreakers: Stat machines like Gyarados and Articuno can tank Blastoise's attacks and retaliate with high neutral damage.<br>
	Grass attacks: Blastoise's sole weakness to grass attacks is a big one, with most Mega Drain users dealing hefty damage and healing a lot.
