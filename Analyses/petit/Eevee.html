<h1>Introduction</h1>



<p>
Eevee has fairly decent stats for Petit Cup standards, being balanced across the board. Eevee is also one of the few Pokemon in the format to have Quick Attack, which gives it good revenge-killing properties against threats like Abra and Diglett. However, Eevee's balanced stats make it a "jack of all trades, master of none" sort of Pokemon, not really excelling in anything. In addition, Eevee tends to compete with Rattata for a Normal-type sweeper, who has slightly higher Attack and Speed, as well as access to Focus Energy and Quick Attack, which makes it quite effective in Stadium. To make matters worse, Eevee has no coverage whatsoever, being strictly limited to Normal-type moves. This makes Gastly a hard counter, not to mention Rock-types like Geodude and Omanyte. Eevee also tends to have issues breaking past Reflect users, in part due to it being a strictly physical attacker. Overall, while Eevee can deal decent damage off of its STABs, that's the full extent of its capabilities.

<h3>Set Details</h3>



<p>

This set is pretty much the full extent of what Eevee can offer. Body Slam is long and far its best STAB, spreading paralysis. It also always has at least a chance to 2HKOing Abra and Diglett; for example, Eevee has a 15% chance at L25 against an L30 Abra. Should Eevee be at least L27, the chances are very favorable for both threats. Quick Attack is crucial for finishing off weakened ones, dealing around 20% to them on average. If Eevee has a significant level advantage against Abra or Diglett, Quick Attack can be used after Body Slam for a KO; L30 is recommended to abuse this. This also gives Eevee excellent general revenge killing capabilities against a variety of threats, such as Charmander, who tends to run rampant late-game with its terrifying Dragon Rage and Slash. Rest can be used to provide Eevee with staying power while abusing Stadium Sleep Clause. In this case, using Double Team alongside it can make Eevee a lot more difficult to take down, as well as make using Rest safer.

<h2>Other Options</h2>



<p>

Mimic gives Eevee an opportunity to find coverage, which is the only way Eevee can hurt Gastly and the Rock-types of the format. Given its bulk, Eevee should be able to effectively pull it off unless something like Machop is in the equation. Substitute can be used to block status, preventing threats such as Pikachu from paralyzing it. Reflect can be used to make Eevee take hits more effectively, which notably helps against Machop, as it ensures Submission will be a 3HKO at best. However, Double Team can be effective in this role instead, as Submission has unreliable accuracy in the first place.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>



<p>

<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly is immune to Normal-type moves, which alone makes this matchup very one-sided. Just switching in Gastly is enough to brutally ruin Eevee's day. The only way Eevee can win against Gastly is through absurd luck with Stadium Struggle, or using Mimic and pulling Psychic or Earthquake.<br><br>
<b>Rock-types: </b>Omanyte and Geodude are particularly brutal here, possessing absurd Defense stats for the format as well as resisting Eevee's STABs. Both effortlessly wall Eevee and KO it with a sequence of STAB attacks. Like with Gastly, the only way to win is a lucky Mimic. <br><br>
<b>Machop: </b>Machop can 2HKO Eevee with Submission, with a KO not giving it recoil in Stadium mechanics. To optimize this, Body Slam can be used first to put it in range. Eevee can only deal around 33% with Body Slam, which while a 57.2% chance to 3HKO, makes this matchup less than favorable if it hasn't used Double Team prior. It should be noted that Double Team adds a good deal of volatility to this matchup, as Submission's accuracy isn't exactly stellar, which can give Eevee potential to win through sheer STAB damage output. Machop can also use Low Kick for consistency, though it needs to be L30 for this to be consistent across all of Eevee's levels. For instance, Eevee can be L28 to avoid the 2HKO from an L25 Machop.<br><br>
