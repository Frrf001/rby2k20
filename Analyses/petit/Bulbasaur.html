<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Bulbasaur is the only Grass-type to get Razor Leaf in Petit Cup, allowing it to serve as a strong attacker on teams with a balanced level composition. While it costs extra 2 levels to use, it's worth it, as Bulbasaur can tear through common Water-types. Bulbasaur also has access to Swords Dance, which gives it mixed attacking possibilities with Body Slam. Bulbasaur often finds itself being used to counter Diglett and Poliwag because of these unique qualities, OHKOing them both. It can also score a nifty 2HKO on Machop with Razor Leaf.</p>

<p>However, Bulbasaur has some pressing issues. It's completely dominated by Exeggcute, Gastly and Charmander, some of the most common threats in the format. Gastly in particular resists Razor Leaf while being immune to Body Slam, giving Bulbasaur no counterplay. Its poor defensive typing also leaves it easily threatened by Blizzard and Psychic, which are very common coverage options. It also sits in a fairly mediocre speed tier, barely being outpaced by Dratini. It's also outsped by Pokemon it's meant to counter, such as Goldeen and Poliwag, often causing it to take unnecessary Blizzards before taking them down. Bulbasaur's Speed is also its ball and chain, making its critical hit Razor Leaf unreliable while causing it to be outsped by common threats. It has no way to make up for this, with a lack of paralysis-inflicting or Speed boosting moves outside of Body Slam. Ergo, most of Bulbasaur's counters, such as Dratini and Growlithe, don't need to boost their Speed or anything to beat it out, which means Bulbasaur has to rely on Body Slam's paralysis for even a hope of winning.</p>

- Swords Dance <br>

- Body Slam <br>

- Razor Leaf <br>

- Substitute <br>

</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
<p>
This should be the set you expect to see from Bulbasaur. Swords Dance allows Bulbasaur to become a much more respectable attacker, with its +2 Body Slam getting a solid 2HKO on Dratini. Its paralysis chance also makes switching into Bulbasaur a bit of a task, with Charmander no longer being a solid counter when considering the damage. Razor Leaf is extremely powerful, having a very high chance for a critical hit. However, this isn't to say it's possible to not get one, as Bulbasaur's Speed makes it less likely than one would expect. Substitute is mostly filler, but blocking status in Stadium makes it much easier to get a Swords Dance. 
</p>

<p>
Bulbasaur should come in on an opponent it can force out, such as Geodude or Krabby. This way, it should be able to score a Swords Dance to go for a sweep. However, finding these opportunities can be difficult, as many Water-types carry Blizzard, making Rock or Ground-types the only real way for Bulbasaur to get in. If there isn't a Pokemon that it can counter, it should be used as a check, first and foremost. Note that against Diglett specifically, a critical hit Razor Leaf will always do more damage than a +2 Body Slam.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>
Toxic+Leech Seed can be used to serve as a win con against an opponent's last Pokemon, while also giving it staying power. Reflect can be used to take less damage from Machop when checking it. Should Bulbasaur be at L25, Mega Drain should be used instead, as it can't learn Razor Leaf until L27.
Bulbasaur makes a good candidate for further level investment to shore up its bulk as well.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gastly: </b>Gastly completely invalidates Bulbasaur, resisting Razor Leaf while being immune to Body Slam. Bulbasaur has little way to fight back, forcing it to switch out. Gastly can also take the opportunity to put something to sleep with Hypnosis.</li>
<li><b>Exeggcute: </b>Exeggcute threatens Bulbasaur with a 2HKO from Psychic, even at L25. Bulbasaur can't deal much back, with +2 Body Slam dealing around a third of its health at best.</li>
<li><b>Charmander and Growlithe: </b>Both Charmander and Growlithe's STAB Fire Blasts deal serious damage to Bulbasaur, usually putting it in range for a Dragon Rage to finish the job. However, Charmander in particular can't switch in due to +2 Body Slam being a 2HKO from Bulbasaur.</li>
<li><b>Farfetch'd: </b>Farfetch'd resists Razor Leaf and has a legitimate threat to 2HKO Bulbasaur with its own +2 STAB Body Slams. Its immunity to Body Slam paralysis and bulk also makes it even more pressing for Bulbasaur.</li>
</ul>
