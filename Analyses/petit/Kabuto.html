<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Kabuto is almost entirely outclassed by Omanyte, which possesses the same typing, is much bulkier, and makes better use of its STAB. The main reason for this is that Kabuto is more physically inclined, but lacks Rock STAB and is less bulkier overall. As a result, Kabuto's damage output is noticeably lower than Omanyte's, which has better Special to use alongside STAB Surf. However, this isn't to say Kabuto lacks a niche over Omanyte, as its Attack is vastly better and allows it to make good use of Body Slam. Kabuto is also a bit faster, outspeeding Sandshrew, both Nidoran, and even unboosted Dratini. Overall though, Kabuto has little use over Omanyte, and is often ignored in favour of it.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This is about the best Kabuto can do, as its movepool is poor. Kabuto can be of any level, as it doesn't gain any moves, which makes it a lot easier to fit on a team. Body Slam is the main call to action for Kabuto, being its only relevant physical attack other than Double-Edge. Surf gives Kabuto STAB, which can be used to take down resists; for example, it OHKOes Geodude and has a ~10% chance to OHKO Sandshrew. Double Team + Rest can be used to make up for Kabuto's mediocre movepool by giving it staying power, but Blizzard can be used over Double Team to 2HKO Dratini.

<p>
Kabuto is best used as a counter to Fire-types, as it has a 4x resistance to Fire Blast. This gives it a relatively safe point of entry for it to begin attacking the opposing team with STAB Surf and Body Slam. However, be wary of Dragon Rage from Charmander and Growlithe, and Vulpix can carry Dig to alleviate concerns of this. Otherwise, it's fairly straightforward, but it's best to ensure Pok√©mon like Bulbasaur and Pikachu are out of the picture first, as they can easily OHKO it with their super-effective STAB attacks. Kabuto is also fairly slow, so a paralyzing the opposing team should give you the best mileage out of it.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Reflect or Harden can boost Kabuto's already high Defense, but Omanyte's physical bulk is better. Mimic, while inconsistent, could also be used to try and get a nice physical move like Earthquake, but often puts it in harm's way when doing so. Lastly, Substitute is a passable option for trying to block a Thunder Wave from something like Magnemite.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
<b>Bulbasaur: </b>Critical hit or not, Bulbasaur's Razor Leaf will always OHKO Kabuto. However, it can't switch into Blizzard, as it's 2HKOed and Kabuto is faster by default.<br><br>
 <b>Gastly: </b>Gastly takes around 24% from Surf and Blizzard, while its Thunderbolt has a ~10% chance to OHKO Kabuto. It also has ample point of entry due to Kabuto mostly clicking Body Slam throughout a game.<br><br>
<b>Electric-types: </b>Pikachu, Voltorb, and Magnemite all threaten Kabuto with an OHKO from their STAB Thunderbolts, with Magnemite's in particular being guaranteed. The only one Kabuto can really threaten is Pikachu, whose weak defensive stats allow Body Slam to be a guaranteed 3HKO.<br><br>
