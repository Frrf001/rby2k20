<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Shellder can be bumped up to at least L29 to avoid a Dragon Rage 2HKO, but this usually means making it L30, which makes Explosion a big risk. Clamp is a valid option for forcing switch situations and cheesing Pokemon in the endgame, but it's much more effective in Yellow Petit Cup.
