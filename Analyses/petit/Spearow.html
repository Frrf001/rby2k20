<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Spearow makes for a decent L30 sweeper in Petit Cup, thanks to its unique access to Drill Peck and solid offensive stats. This allows it to threaten Exeggcute and Bulbasaur excellently, as well as KO Machop if it's taken any amount of chip prior. These qualities make Spearow well-suited for the late game, as well as serve as a good revenge killer. However, Spearow suffers from extreme fragility, making it easily 2HKOed by super-effective attacks, like Pikachu's STAB Thunderbolt. This means Spearow often has to play a hit-and-run playstyle to be successful, lest it be effortlessly KOed. This also makes paralysis extremely threatening to it, allowing faster Pokémon with Thunder Wave force it out. In addition, while decently fast, Spearow is still outsped by common threats like Abra, Diglett, and Gastly. To make matters worse, Spearow tends to be difficult to fit onto teams due to it mandating the use of Drill Peck, which requires it to be at least L29. As a result, Spearow is usually relegated to teams utilizing L30s in tandem with L25s. Overall, Spearow stands as a high-risk, high-reward Pokémon that can definitely make an impact, but sometimes it can be naught but dead weight.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This is generally what you should expect when you see Spearow. Drill Peck is its claim to fame, dealing large amounts of damage to whatever it touches. Due to a lack of Body Slam, Double-Edge is used to round out the STAB while dealing fair amounts of damage. In Stadium, it should be noted that KOing a foe with Double-Edge will allow Spearow to skip taking recoil. Mirror Move is mostly filler, but can allow Spearow to utilize moves like Earthquake after switching in on something like Geodude. Substitute allows Spearow to survive for longer while not being affected by paralysis.

<p>
Spearow, as mentioned before, should play a hit-and-run playstyle, due to its fragility. Since Spearow is so fragile, it should come in only on passive foes or those who won't deal heavy damage to it. As such, switching in on foes using Rest or revenge killing should be the primary points of entry for Spearow. Using it for one-for-one trades is a fair option as well.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Swift can be used to counter evasion-based movesets, and since Spearow gets STAB off of it, it will deal fair damage. Spearow can use Double Team itself to increase staying power, but this tends to be hazardous as it usually requires use over multiple turns to be effective.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
 
 
 
<b>Rock-types: </b>Spearow is stonewalled by Rock-types, as its only attacking moves are resisted by them. Spearow can situationally beat Geodude by switching in on Earthquake and subsequently using Mirror Move, but this is unreliable and subject to prediction. This doesn't help against Omanyte and Kabuto though, as they not only don't get Earthquake, but can OHKO Spearow with Blizzard.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Electric-types: </b>Pikachu and Voltorb especially hurt Spearow due to their Speed combined with Thunder Wave, which alone forces it out. They can also 2HKO Spearow with Thunderbolt. Pikachu has issues switching in, though, as a Double-Edge from Spearow will deal a large chunk of damage. Magnemite, while slower, also threatens Spearow with a OHKO with Thunderbolt.<br><br>
