<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>

Goldeen is unique as a Water-type, in that it gets the ever-cheesy Horn Drill. Well, it also gets Peck, but it's largely useless. When coupled with STAB BubbleBeam, Goldeen can use Horn Drill pretty liberally, as a Speed drop guarantees Goldeen will outspeed even Voltorb. On top of this, Goldeen isn't bad on the offensive front either, possessing some of the highest Attack in the format. As a result, it makes for a decent user of Double-Edge, 2HKOing Abra and Diglett. However, Goldeen's Special isn't that great, and coupled with a poor HP stat, Goldeen will often find itself OHKOed by super-effective hits. For instance, Magnemite's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed OHKO. Paralysis also completely ruins Goldeen's strategy, as Horn Drill only works on slower Pokemon. Goldeen also has natural inconsistency due to its niche being centred on OHKO moves: if it fails, it's often in a poor position. However, the payoff is enough for Goldeen to have a solid niche in the format.

<h3>Set Details</h3>

<p>

Goldeen should always be at least L26, as it takes it out of Dragon Rage's 2HKO range. BubbleBeam + Horn Drill gives Goldeen a super good shot at cheesing a KO, which in a 3v3 format can be big for a team. It should also be noted that Diglett and Sandshrew are 2HKOed by BubbleBeam, and Geodude is OHKOed. Surf can be used to OHKO Diglett and Sandshrew instead, though level difference can make this more difficult. Alternatively, Blizzard can be used instead to hit Dratini and Bulbasaur. Double-Edge allows Goldeen to put its good Attack to use, 2HKOing Abra and allowing it to pick off other foes quite effectively.

<p>

Goldeen should be played late-game, as it's likely that many Pokemon have been paralyzed by this point. As a result, Goldeen won't have to use BubbleBeam to try and get Horn Drill off. Goldeen isn't the sturdiest Pokemon in the world as well - remember, it's just barely avoiding a 2HKO from Dragon Rage at L26 - as such, it should try to avoid taking too many hits to succeed. Goldeen should also avoid paralysis at all costs, as getting paralyzed will prevent it from using its Horn Drill gimmick at all.

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>

Most of the time, if you're using a different set, the other Water-types of the format will likely pull it off better than Goldeen. However, it does have some other potential tricks up its sleeve. Supersonic gives Goldeen the possibility of screwing with leads, but its accuracy is very low and decreases Goldeen's already iffy consistency. Substitute can be used to prevent Goldeen from being paralyzed in Stadium, which can be crucial against threats like Ekans, Voltorb and Pikachu. This also gives Goldeen the potential to take more hits and absorb Dragon Rage at lower HP values. Pumping more levels into Goldeen can make this less of an issue or even speed creep them, but this decreases your ally's movepools, making Goldeen harder to fit on a team overall.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>

<b>Faster Pokemon: </b>

Faster Pokemon, such as Voltorb, need to be hit with a BubbleBeam Speed drop to be a possible target for Horn Drill. While many of these are frail and good targets for Double-Edge, there are outliers who pose a decent enough threat to not be worth the risk.<br><br>

<b>Paralysis Inducers: </b>Paralysis invalidates Goldeen's Horn Drill, making it significantly less threatening to a team. Voltorb and Pikachu will frequently force Goldeen out due to this, as they are not only faster, but can deal severe damage with STAB Thunderbolts. Abra will also tend to paralyze Goldeen if it tries to 2HKO with Double-Edge, which makes this quality less appetizing unless Goldeen has already served its purpose.<br><br>

<b>Gastly: </b>Not only is Gastly immune to Horn Drill and Double-Edge, but it also takes minimal damage from Goldeen's special attacks while 2HKOing it with Thunderbolt. Even if made L30, Goldeen can't even 2HKO Gastly with STAB Surf, making this matchup quite lopsided.<br><br>

<b>Magnemite:</b>While Magnemite is slower than Goldeen, and as such is a Horn Drill target, it favourably OHKOes Goldeen with Thunderbolt unless there is a significant level difference.<br><br>

<b>Bulbasaur: </b>L27 Bulbasaur can use Razor Leaf to fish for critical hits, which can potentially 2HKO Goldeen. However, it's 2HKOed by Blizzard as well, which makes this matchup go either way a lot of the time.<br><br>
