<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Dratini is among the best Pokémon in Petit Cup for its good defensive typing, and most of all, the coveted combination of Agility, Dragon Rage, and Wrap. This gives Dratini excellent versatility and sometimes even use as a win-con. Its wide attacking movepool blends excellently with its access to moves like Thunder Wave, allowing it to work as a late-game cleaner or lead. Given a turn, if a team isn't prepared for Dratini, it can be a very difficult Pokémon to defeat. Overall, Dratini stands as a very effective cleaner in the format with great flexibility. 
</p>
 
 
<p>
However, Dratini is also very flawed. Dratini starts off very slow, often needing paralysis support or a turn to get Agility off. As a result, it's not the most self-sufficient Pokémon around, and will often find itself being forced out if it comes in at the wrong time. This makes Pokémon like Voltorb and Pikachu very good counterplay options, as they can switch in on Wrap and force it out with the threat of paralysis, which cripples it until it can use Agility again. Dratini also has a glaring weakness to Blizzard and not the finest Special, which often leads it to an early grave. The existence of Evasion in the format also severely hurts Dratini's consistency, as Wrap's already iffy accuracy becomes noticeably worse after even a single boost.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This is the average AgiliWrap set for Dratini. For maximum potency, it should be given as many levels as possible for a team. Wrap and Agility are indispensable and are what give Dratini its viability. The combination of Agility and Wrap enable Dratini to continuously keep the opponent immobilized before finishing them off with Dragon Rage. Blizzard can be used for Dratini mirrors, which is a 2HKO, dealing 64.1% minimum if both are L30. However, Thunder Wave can be used to net paralysis, which is helpful for stopping Pokémon like Pikachu from impeding its sweep. 
</p>
 
<p>
A thing to remember is that Dratini is extremely vulnerable to paralysis, and also needs to set up Agility. Even if it's paralyzed, remember that in Stadium, the speed drop from paralysis isn't removed, and Wrap's hit rate will drop to ~66% considering potential full paralysis with the accuracy. As such, Dratini should be trying to avoid paralysis at all times. This can be achieved through pivoting with Wrap or switching to a Ground-type teammate, like Diglett or Sandshrew. Dratini should be kept in the back so that it can clean up the opposing team as well; sometimes, +2 Speed and Dragon Rage is all it needs to finish the game off. However, Dratini is perfectly fine as a paralysis lead in some situations.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Replacing a move on Dratini normally means replacing the Blizzard slot, which can be a bit risky, as it means losing the mirror. However, Dratini has a very wide movepool which makes it very possible to do. Body Slam can be used to allow Dratini to potentially spread paralysis while using its respectable Attack stat, which helps against Diglett, Abra, and Pikachu; all three of these will usually be subsequently KOed by Dragon Rage. Thunderbolt is another attractive option, allowing Dratini to hit the Water-types of the format; most notably, it hits Omanyte, which has a guaranteed 2HKO on it with Blizzard.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
As with most AgiliWrap Pokémon, the best way to hurt Dratini is by attacking its consistency. Once boosted, there isn't much in the way of preventing Wrap chains, so playing the long game and waiting for it to stop on its own is best. This makes Evasion a good option to out it, as Wrap's already poor accuracy becomes even worse against a Pokémon that has raised its Evasion even once. Quick Attack users tend to do well at whittling Dratini down during Wrap turns, especially Eevee, who happens to have the most damaging one. Toxic is also a fair but niche option, as Dratini will end up taking more damage than it deals.<br><br>
 
<b>Evasion: </b>While a cheesy way to out it, Double Team users such as Pikachu, and those with poor movepools like Eevee and Voltorb, can greatly reduce Wrap's consistency using Evasion. Two uses of Double Team will give Wrap a roughly 48% chance to hit, a significant drop. This makes Double Team + Rest combinations a bit difficult for Dratini to deal with, especially in Stadium where Speed drops from paralysis are removed immediately.<br><br>
 
 
 
<b>Pikachu and Voltorb: </b>While Pikachu and Voltorb can't directly contest Dratini, their Speed alongside Thunder Wave makes them prime candidate as Wrap absorbers, as they can wait out the turns and paralyze Dratini. Both can even outspeed an unboosted L30 Dratini at L25, meaning Dratini has no choice but to switch out in this situation. Pikachu also happens to have access to Quick Attack, allowing it to continuously whittle down Dratini during Wrap turns while preventing it from safely switching out after a boost. However, after a boost, both have to rely on a miss. As outlined before, Double Team variants are a particular headache for Dratini.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Omanyte: </b>An Omanyte that's at least L27 can avoid the 2HKO from Dratini's Dragon Rage and attempt to 2HKO it with Blizzard, though Wrap can force it into 2HKO range at this level. However, Wrap only deals 1 HP per turn regardless of level, though 2 damage can happen 1/40th of the time. At L30, Omanyte has 88 HP, which means it can take a full Wrap round and still be out of 2HKO range from Dragon Rage, giving it slightly more opportunity to take out Dratini. In addition, at this level, Blizzard has a 28.2% chance to OHKO it outright. It should be noted that Thunderbolt can 3HKO, but deals less damage than Dragon Rage more often than not without a large level difference.<br><br>
