<h1>Introduction</h1> 

 

<p> 

 

Pidgey is an underwhelming threat in the Petit Cup metagame. With middling stats and a mediocre movepool at best, Pidgey struggles to make an impact. It's stonewalled by Gastly and Geodude due to its lack of coverage, making it very easy to stop. However, it does have some minor qualities that give it somewhat of a niche. Its Flying typing gives it an immunity to Earthquake, which provides it with some points of entry. On top of this, it's one of the few Pokémon in the metagame with access to Quick Attack, which allows it to pick off fast and frail threats like Abra. It also makes Pidgey substantially better at dealing with Agility users. Outside of this though, Pidgey doesn't have much to offer, often being outclassed by Spearow and Farfetch'd as a Flying-type.

<h3>Set Details</h3> 

 

<p> 

 

This is about all that Pidgey can muster in terms of a moveset. While Pidgey doesn't get Body Slam, Double-Edge hits surprisingly hard, especially against frailer threats. Quick Attack gives Pidgey priority, and since it's the main reason you would use it, it should also be considered mandatory. Pidgey doesn't have much in the way of other attacks though, but Double Team + Rest is always a decent combination to try and give it staying power. Should Evasion tactics not be enticing, Pidgey can have levels invested to allow it to use Wing Attack, which allows it to hit Gastly and 2HKO Paras. However, it's pitifully weak outside of these roles, and is mostly novelty.

In the rare case you use Pidgey, it should be used to pick off weakened threats. This is best done by bringing it in on an Earthquake from threats like Sandshrew and Diglett, though you should be wary of Rock Slide. After that, Pidgey should attempt to take out the foe in one go using the STAB most appropriate for the situation. All in all, Pidgey should use a hit and run playstyle.

<h2>Other Options</h2> 

 

<p> 

 

Pidgey does have some alternative options, though they're not great. Substitute allows Pidgey to block Thunder Wave paralysis, but Double Team + Rest tends to work just fine for avoiding it while giving Pidgey stalling capabilities. Sky Attack or Fly could be used alongside Substitute, but it's inconsistent and smart switching tends to foil the plan quite quickly. Toxic could be used to get chip damage in, though a lot of the time paralysis is more desirable.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2> 

 

<p> 

 

<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly is immune to Double-Edge and Quick Attack, is faster, and has Hypnosis access. It can easily 2HKO Pidgey with Thunderbolt, sometimes OHKO with the right level difference. All Pidgey can do here is try to 5HKO with Wing Attack. This is an extremely lopsided matchup. <br><br> 

 

<b>Geodude: </b>Geodude resists literally every attacking move Pidgey has, and can destroy it with Rock Slide. While Pidgey can use Toxic to try and put Geodude on a timer as counterplay, it's already on one given it's going to Explode eventually anyway. There's just not much Pidgey can do here.<br><br> 

 

<b>Pikachu and Magnemite: </b>Both have powerful STAB Thunderbolts to throw at Pidgey, usually OHKOing it. Pikachu does have more risk involved if trying to counter Pidgey though, as Double-Edge is a very likely 2HKO. As a result, a paralyzed Pikachu is not a Pidgey counter. <br><br> 

 

<b>Omanyte and Kabuto: </b>While any Water-type with Blizzard can qualify here, these two are the best at pulling this off thanks to their resistance to any attack Pidgey throws at them. Omanyte can OHKO Pidgey with Blizzard, while Kabuto will always 2HKO. However, Kabuto doesn't tend to carry Blizzard all the time. Kabuto's Body Slam is a near-guaranteed 3HKO regardless, and Pidgey deals around 16% with Double-Edge while continually sustaining recoil anyway, effectively guaranteeing said 3HKO.<br><br>
