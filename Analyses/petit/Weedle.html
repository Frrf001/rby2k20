<h1>Introduction</h1> 

 

<p> 

Being prevented from entering metamorphosis for 18 levels, Weedle is a touch better than Caterpie for its access to Poison Sting along with better Attack and Speed, but that's all that can be said about it. Weedle does pitiful damage to teams and is forced to pray to inflict poison from its Poison Sting. In fact, the poison chip damage is often more than the damage Weedle is actually doing. Outside of this, well, String Shot guarantees Weedle will outspeed every foe in the tier if it survives the turn. Weedle's defenses are pitiful; its weaknesses only serve to make this worse, and it should never be considered for an offensive team.

<h3>Set Details</h3> 

<p> 

By obligation and not by choice, this is all Weedle can offer to a team. Poison Sting has a possible 6HKO on Caterpie, and a guaranteed 3HKO on Paras, who has a 4x weakness to Poison. However, with any amount of level investment on either, it can't even achieve that. String Shot exists so Weedle can at least outspeed something and potentially get more chances to get the Poison in before dying. There's nothing else this Pokémon can do, man.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2> 

<p> 

There is not a single Pokémon that Weedle can beat one-on-one without extreme luck. However, there are some standout cases that are particularly sad.<br><br> 

 

<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly literally takes 1.7% on average and threatens Weedle with half the universe. The worst that can happen to Gastly here is if its Speed gets dropped and is subsequently threatened by something that now checks it.<br><br> 

 

<b>Geodude: </b>Geodude may as well have an immunity to Poison Sting, and isn't affected by String Shot since it's already one of the slowest Pokémon in the format. Even poison isn't too rewarding since it'll explode anyway, and STAB Rock Slide puts a swift end to Weedle's dreams of actually getting a KO.<br><br> 

 

<b>Sandshrew: </b>Sandshrew takes like 2.8% on average, and that's with maximum level difference. Sandshrew can use Swords Dance liberally and subsequently threaten to sweep the opposing team with a mix of Earthquakes and Rock Slides. If it isn't running the Swords Dance set, well, it's a free KO.<br><br>
