<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>
Farfetch'd has fairly well-rounded stats, serving like a slower but much bulkier Spearow. With access to Swords Dance, Farfetch'd is capable of hitting damage numbers Spearow couldn't even dream of, which coupled with the paralysis chance of Body Slam means it usually won't go down without crippling at least something. However, Farfetch'd is slower than Spearow, which does give it some issues; it's notably outsped by Goldeen and Charmander, both of which can deal serious damage. This also makes Farfetch'd a Horn Drill target. In addition, Farfetch'd doesn't get access to Drill Peck, which tends to make Spearow a better L30 pick, as it gets Drill Peck at L29 anyway. This doesn't mean Farfetch'd is a worse ace though, as its ability to set up makes it much more threatening in the long run. Overall, while similar to Spearow, Farfetch'd goes about its business quite differently.

<p>
In the grand scheme of things though, Farfetch'd struggles a bit. Gastly's presence in the metagame is a massive problem for it, as it's immune to the one thing that makes it viable: +2 Body Slam. This comes with its severe lack of coverage, with its only moves being STABs. This makes Farfetch'd fairly linear, predictable, and as such lacking in build variety. It also lacks immediate power, relying on Swords Dance to get its meaningful damage in.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
<p>
 
This is a basic Farfetch'd set. Swords Dance allows Farfetch'd to hit extremely hard with +2 Body Slam, nearly OHKOing Charmander and 2HKOing most of the metagame overall. Peck is used to get a guaranteed 2HKO on L27 Gastly at +2, which is crucial given its wide presence in the metagame. However, outside of this and Paras, the move tends to deal less damage than Body Slam overall. Rest allows Farfetch'd to remove paralysis Speed drops while restoring health, and it can find good opportunities to recover given its bulk.

<p>
Farfetch'd is a Flying-type, which allows it to come in on Earthquake for free. However, since Geodude hard counters it due to resisting Body Slam, it's best to keep to switching in on Sandshrew, Cubone, or Diglett, unless it's to double switch. These threats often come with Rock Slide, but Double Team can reduce the consistency of it, to the point that Farfetch'd should have the RNG in its favor. Outside of this, since Grass-types can't really do much to it, Farfetch'd can find setup opportunities on Pokémon like Bulbasaur with relative ease. This also applies to burning Rest turns. Note that Farfetch'd can't be paralyzed by Body Slam as well, which makes it a slightly safer switch-in to +2 Bulbasaur.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>
Farfetch'd has a fair selection of options. Double Team can be used over Peck on L25 sets, as the move's effectiveness is largely diminished if Farfetch'd drops even a single level. Reflect can be used to make it even bulkier, but this is a bit inefficient, as Farfetch'd really wants to use Swords Dance and should be threatening the opposing team from then on.
</p>
 
<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly invalidates Farfetch'd a lot of the time, with only +2 L30 Peck coming close as counterplay. Gastly can 2HKO Farfetch'd a lot of the time with Thunderbolt, or threaten with sleep from Hypnosis at L27.<br><br>
 
<b>Rock-types: </b>Geodude stonewalls Farfetch'd, resisting every attack it has and threatening a 2HKO with Rock Slide, even at L25. In similar fashion, Omanyte and Kabuto resist every attack Farfetch'd has, and can threaten with 2HKOs from their Blizzards. However, +2 L30 Body Slam does do significant damage to all of these Pokémon regardless, allowing Farfetch'd to situationally win the interaction with a 3HKO. This will likely require some lucky paralysis, though.<br><br>
 
<b>Pikachu and Voltorb: </b>Pikachu and Voltorb outspeed Farfetch'd and threaten with 2HKOs from their STAB Thunderbolts. However, both are OHKOed by +2 L30 Body Slam, meaning they will have issues switching in to defuse the situation. Voltorb can avoid the OHKO at L29 and above, and make it very unfavorable at L28, but Pikachu is OHKOed over 90% of the time even at L30.<br><br>
