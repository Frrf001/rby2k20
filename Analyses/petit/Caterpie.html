<h1>Introduction</h1> 

 

<p> 

 

You're laughing. You stopped a Caterpie from evolving into a Metapod at least 18 times, and you're laughing. Seriously though, Caterpie sucks and should not be used in any competitive capacity. It exists solely to be food for Gastly and the only remote reason you'd use it is for its unique access to String Shot. Even then, Weedle would likely do better for its ability to poison Pokémon with Poison Sting. However, one interesting thing about Caterpie is that it can outspeed every Pokémon in the metagame bar Voltorb if String Shot hits.

<h3>Set Details</h3> 

 

<p> 

 

You don't use these moves by choice, but by obligation. Did you know Tackle and String Shot both have 95% accuracy? Yeah, Caterpie can't even afford consistency. We're going with L30 here, since it allows Tackle to be a possible 5HKO on Abra, which is the best Caterpie will ever get in a match. This thing sucks.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2> 

 

<p> 

 

Caterpie is essentially hard countered by every single Pokémon, but these are some standout ones.<br><br> 

 

<b>Gastly: </b>Without Stadium Struggle or Gastly using Struggle itself, Caterpie literally cannot win against Gastly. This can be seen among the worst matchups in Pokémon history.<br><br> 

 

<b>Geodude: </b>Geodude shrugs off Tackle and is basically unaffected by String Shot due to already being slow. Add on STAB Rock Slide and you have yourself a free matchup.<br><br>
