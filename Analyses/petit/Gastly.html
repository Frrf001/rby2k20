<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Gastly is a fantastic pick in Petit Cup and sometimes even considered a ubiquitous pick on teams. Its immunity to Body Slam allows it to single-handedly win matchups due to many Pokémon lacking in coverage. In addition, it's an offensive powerhouse, with its Thunderbolt often landing a 3HKO or even 2HKO on most threats in the format. With this coming from its high Special, it's also perfectly fine in terms of Special bulk, giving it plentiful points of entry. With excellent Speed to boot, it can be very difficult to prevent Gastly from ending games once a team has been sufficiently weakened. Gastly is among the best Pokémon in Petit Cup and demands respect.

<p>
Despite its overwhelming positives, Gastly does have notable issues that must be considered to be successful with it. Gastly's physical bulk is mediocre, and its weakness to Earthquake can lead to an early death if it switches in willy-nilly. Gastly is also weak to two other top threats, Abra and Diglett, whose STAB moves deal severe damage to it; this usually leads to it Exploding early. Outside of this, however, Gastly's weaknesses are minimal.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Being L27 takes Gastly out of Dragon Rage 2HKO range and adds set ambiguity, as it learns Hypnosis at this level. However, L30 Gastly can add even more firepower while outspeeding L27 Base-90s like Poliwag. Confuse Ray allows Gastly to act as an anti-lead should team preview allow it to function as such, which can be vital for preventing paralysis and other status from spreading early on. Thunderbolt is Gastly's main attacking option, dealing major damage if the target isn't immune. Mega Drain can be used to dispatch Geodude coming in to try and stop Thunderbolt, but Night Shade is perfectly fine for flexibility, though it should be L30 in this case. Explosion allows Gastly to take targets down with it, allowing for the player to maintain momentum.

<p>
Gastly can be used in any game state, though late-game is often more effective to get a sweep. This is because its Speed and Special make it much more effective at ending games, and it minimizes the risks imposed by its physical fragility. Gastly should explode once foes are at around half HP, as this is when it's most likely to get the KO; remember, Gastly's Explosion isn't as powerful as it seems. Should a KO not be achieved, focus on revenge-killing the threat with something like Diglett.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Hypnosis is a valid alternative to Confuse Ray, especially in Yellow Petit Cup.
Substitute can be used to avoid paralysis, though it's difficult to justify a moveslot due to how important its offensive options are. Psychic is also potentially useful for Poison-types like Ekans and other Gastly, but in a similar vein to Substitute, it's difficult to justify adding it.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
<b>Abra: </b>Abra is capable of 2HKOing Gastly with Psychic even with level difference, and a critical hit is a very likely OHKO. It can also paralyze Gastly with Thunder Wave, crippling it. This matchup is fairly straightforward and Gastly should switch out unless it intends to Explode.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Diglett: </b>Unless Gastly is L30 and there isn't much of a level difference, Diglett will OHKO Gastly with Earthquake. Gastly can't do much back here, even with Mega Drain, which deals about a third.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Sandshrew and Cubone: </b>Sandshrew and Cubone don't take too much from Mega Drain, are immune to Thunderbolt, and can deal severe damage to Gastly with their use of Earthquake. Even with maximum level difference, Sandshrew has a 87.2% chance to OHKO Gastly with Earthquake.<br><br>
