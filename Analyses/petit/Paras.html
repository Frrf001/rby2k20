<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Paras is in a weird spot in Petit Cup. It has the Tajiri-given right to Spore, a fully accurate Sleep move, but is cripplingly slow to the point that Substitute hard counters the strategy. Couple this with sleep being generally less powerful than in traditional RBY, and Paras becomes noticeably less appealing. However, this isn't to say Paras is bad; to the contrary, accurate sleep remains a relevant threat to put powerful foes out of commission, and having the best sleep move in the game is not to be taken lightly. In addition, Stun Spore provides Paras with the ability to run a decent Double Powder set against Pokémon that do not use Substitute. Paras also boasts one of the highest Attack stats in Petit Cup, which can be boosted by Swords Dance to rival even Krabby. As a result, Paras has a solid niche.

However, as implied, Paras struggles mightily in the metagame as well. Its defensive typing is atrocious and only becomes worse with the Fire Blasts and Blizzards flying around the format. With its Speed being the second worst in the format in addition to this, Paras is pretty much dead weight in many instances. As mentioned before, Substitute is a very strong way to out Paras in Stadium, preventing it from even getting a Spore off due to it being so unforgivably slow. As a result, Paras will normally be only able to use Spore when an opponent is switching out.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This is about all that Paras can muster. The given level takes Paras out of 2HKO range from Dragon Rage, which can be crucial in preventing a sweep. Spore is imperative when using Paras, otherwise it essentially doesn't have a niche; you'd be better off using Oddish or Bellsprout in that case. Stun Spore allows Paras to paralyze another Pokémon, crippling two for the rest of the game. This can also allow Paras to make better use of its offensive potential, likely being faster than the victim. Mega Drain acts as STAB to muscle past Geodude while recovering health. This also allows Paras to serve as an Omanyte check, a rare commodity in Petit Cup. Body Slam allows Paras to use its Attack stat while spreading paralysis.

Paras is a difficult Pokémon to use, as it's likely going to take a hit before it can do anything, and with its sheer amount of weaknesses, it's likely going to hurt. As a result, Paras should be bought in against Grass-types or Electric-types to try and minimize the chance of punishment while utilizing the few resistances it has. If Paras can force something out, it's a free Spore, which should be its central goal. After that, its job is essentially done, and its next aim should be to deal as much damage as possible before it finally goes down.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Swords Dance can be used over Mega Drain to boost Paras's Attack to sky-high levels, making Body Slam a fairly powerful move. However, actually setting this up is quite difficult, as Paras is not only slow, but painfully easy to 2HKO. It's best to use something like Sandshrew or Krabby for this role instead, whose +2 Body Slams are more powerful than Paras's.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
 
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly's only concern is Spore, which can be solved through the use of Substitute. In addition, Gastly is immune to Body Slam, and takes virtually nothing from Mega Drain. Paras has essentially nothing it can do here, except maybe use Dig, which is unreliable at best.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Flying-types: </b>Every Flying-type in Petit Cup carries Substitute in some form, resists Mega Drain, and has enough power to muscle past Paras. Not including Zubat, every Flying-type in Petit Cup is also part Normal-type, which makes them immune to Body Slam's paralysis. For good measure, they're also immune to Dig. All Paras can do against these Pokémon is switch out.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Fire-types: </b>While Charmander, Vulpix, and Growlithe despise Paralysis from Stun Spore or Body Slam, they can nuke Paras with STAB Fire Blast.<br><br>
 
 
 
<b>Water-types with Blizzard: </b>Almost every Water-type, while they dislike Mega Drain, usually carries Blizzard, which a lot of the time will 3HKO Paras through Mega Drain recovery. As a result, they serve as suitable Paras checks.
