<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Cubone finds itself mostly outclassed by Sandshrew, which has higher Speed and offensive presence than Cubone, in addition to Swords Dance and Slash access. However, Cubone distinguishes itself with access to a small Special movepool, letting it effectively use Blizzard to muscle past its checks. Cubone has access to Counter as well, which along with its decent defensive bulk, allows it to check Body Slam users attempting to spread paralysis. These qualities allow Cubone to have a solid niche over Sandshrew, with its ways of weaving into game-winning scenarios being quite different.
</p>
 
 
<p>
Cubone does have some severe issues preventing it from being the norm, though. Its damage output is leagues below Sandshrew, whose access to Slash and Swords Dance give it ample flexibility in terms of how to go about its sweep. Not only this, Cubone's Attack is much lower at base, losing out on many valuable calcs. Its Speed is also lower, equal with Omanyte and slower than Shellder, making these matchups much more difficult. Overall, while Cubone's unique qualities make it a niche pick on teams, it's often stuck in Sandshrew's shadow.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This set aims to make the best use of Cubone's unique qualities. Cubone's Earthquake is a solid STAB move, even having a good chance to OHKO Charmander outright. Body Slam gives Cubone opportunity to paralyze foes, making up for its mediocre Speed. Blizzard is its call to action offensively, 2HKOing Bulbasaur, Exeggcute, Farfetch'd, and Pidgey, while having a minor chance to freeze as a bonus. Counter gives Cubone the opportunity to sting Normal-type attackers, as well as Submission Machop, forcing them to rethink their offense before taking Cubone head-on.

<p>
Cubone tends to be decent in the mid-game once a few threats have been paralyzed; this also gives it slightly more opportunity to use Counter. Having a Flying-type in the back can be quite handy when using Counter, as many threats will attempt to use Earthquake to check if Cubone is carrying it while getting damage in. Once its checks—namely Grass-types—have been paralyzed, it can usually win the interactions thanks to Blizzard, forcing its way in.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Fissure can be used alongside a ton of paralysis support to potentially score OHKOs, but this tends to be a bit excessive and inconsistent. BubbleBeam has valid utility for fighting Geodude, but this usually means dropping Counter due to the value of Blizzard, narrowing its potential to check Body Slam users.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
<b>Water-types: </b>Cubone has little in the way of muscling past Water-types, especially Poliwag, Horsea, and Goldeen, the last of which can try to OHKO Cubone with Horn Drill. Cubone's Special bulk is only mediocre, and it will usually find itself forced out by threat of a 2HKO or even an OHKO.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Bulbasaur: </b>While Cubone can certainly win against Grass-types thanks to Blizzard's sheer power, Bulbasaur is far and away the most difficult. It's faster, the sole user of Razor Leaf in the format, and at L27 will tend to live Blizzard through level difference. Even at L30, Cubone will be outsped by Bulbasaur by one point, and will take near-fatal damage from a critical hit Razor Leaf in the process of trying to force its way through. Generally, Bulbasaur should be paralyzed before even thinking of trying to force through with Cubone.
