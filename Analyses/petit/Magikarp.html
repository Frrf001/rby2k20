<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>
 
True to the Pokédex entry, Magikarp is a weak and pathetic Pokémon with no conceivable niche, at least in international metagames. In Japanese metagames, Magikarp was blessed with the Tamamushi University event which gave it Dragon Rage, but a lack of trading between Japanese and English games makes it illegal here. Due to Magikarp's Speed, it becomes the fastest Dragon Rage user in Petit Cup, which is certainly no niche to sniff at. As a result of the legality issue, though, Magikarp can be seen as firmly above Caterpie and Weedle in viability, but certainly a poor choice.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
 
This is all Magikarp can offer in Petit Cup, and you're not using this by choice. Without Dragon Rage, it just doesn't deal enough damage. Even against Diglett, there's only a possible 6HKO with Tackle. The only benefit to Magikarp's moveset is the sheer amount of PP it has, really. We're using an L30 Magikarp here to maximize the damage output and Speed, since if you're using Magikarp you may as well make the best of such an unfortunate situation.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
 
As mentioned before, in Japanese Petit Cup, Dragon Rage Magikarp becomes available. Thanks to Magikarp's typing and Speed, it can sustain a Dragon Rage assault for enough turns to score at least a KO.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
 
To say Magikarp can even KO a Pokémon handled by an experienced player, without Dragon Rage, would be a mockery to Pokémon design itself. However, should the mighty Magikarp be tearing up your teams, there are two particularly strong outs to it.<br><br>
 
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly is immune to Tackle and possesses a favourable OHKO on Magikarp with Thunderbolt if it's at least L27. Even Caterpie has a better matchup thanks to String Shot.<br><br>
 
<b>Rock-types: </b>Any Rock-type can beat Magikarp; Omanyte, Kabuto, and Geodude all possess excellent Defense and resist Tackle. Therefore, Magikarp will be KOed by their appropriate move of choice unless they're at extremely low HP before they can deal meaningful damage. It should be noted that Geodude can be 2HKOed by Dragon Rage without level investment in Japanese formats, though.<br><br>
