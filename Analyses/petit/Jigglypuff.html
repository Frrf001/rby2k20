<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Jigglypuff finds itself mostly outclassed by Clefairy, but it has some solid niches that make it worth using on some teams. For starters, Jigglypuff is the only Pokémon in Petit Cup that's capable of avoiding a 3HKO from Dragon Rage; with minimal level investment, Jigglypuff can reach 124 HP. In addition, this amount of HP also makes it an extremely good user of Counter, functioning as a solid Machop lure. This, combined with its typing, also makes it a good way of stopping Body Slam users without a teammate getting paralyzed. Just like Clefairy, Jigglypuff has a solid support movepool, with access to Thunder Wave, Sing, and more, with STAB Body Slam for good measure.
</p>
 
 
<p>
However, while Jigglypuff's unique traits help, it's marred by issues. Much unlike Clefairy, Jigglypuff's damage output is decidedly mediocre, its Attack stat being tied with Pokémon like Meowth and Pidgey, for scale. Its Special stat is also horrific, being a measly 25, tied with Krabby and Rattata. This makes Jigglypuff almost solely relegated to Body Slam for reliable damage, making it easily seen as a passive threat. On the defensive side, this also makes Jigglypuff struggle mightily against Gastly and Abra, which are both adept at exploiting Jigglypuff's flaws while invalidating the threat of Counter completely. Overall, Jigglypuff has a solid niche in Petit Cup, but Clefairy should always be looked at first. They can be used together with success, though.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Body Slam is Jigglypuff's main source of damage, and can help spread paralysis in tandem with Thunder Wave. Given Jigglypuff's incredible bulk and ability to check Dragon Rage users, these two moves are very helpful for stopping Dratini and Charmander from running rampant. Counter is another big part of what makes Jigglypuff work, allowing it to net a surprise KO against the many Body Slam users of the format while being immune to its paralysis. Rest gives Jigglypuff an opportunity to pad out its bulk and stonewall Dragon Rage users with greater effect.
</p>
 
 
<p>
Jigglypuff acts as a great early-game switch-in, sometimes even a lead, by virtue of its extreme survivability. This makes it work as a fair paralysis lead, disabling a Pokémon from the get-go. Should Jigglypuff not be favourable as a lead, it can still find perfectly fine points of entry through Dragon Rage users, and stall them out using Rest while paralyzing them. Alternatively, if Body Slam—a common move on these types of Pokémon—is anticipated, Counter can be used for massive damage. 
</p>
 
 
<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Seismic Toss or Psychic can be used for Gastly, though the latter doesn't do much due to Jigglypuff's awful damage output on the Special side. Sing can be used over Thunder Wave in Yellow Petit Cup. Thunderbolt and Blizzard can be used to cover Jigglypuff's problematic matchups, but it can't win against any of them without them taking prior chip damage.
 
</p>
 
 
 
<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
<p>
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly is capable of 3HKOing Jigglypuff with Thunderbolt, and while it is 3HKOed by the rare Psychic itself, it will still win the interaction from full HP. It can also threaten Jigglypuff with Sleep, and is immune to Body Slam.<br><br>
 
<b>Rock-types: </b>Jigglypuff has a hard time against Rock-types, especially Omanyte, which takes middling damage from Thunderbolt while 2HKOing it with Surf.<br><br>
 
<b>Exeggcute: </b>Even with Blizzard, Jigglypuff can't win against Exeggcute in prolonged interactions, being 3HKOed by Psychic.
