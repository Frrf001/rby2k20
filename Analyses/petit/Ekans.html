<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Ekans has some fairly unique traits that can make it worth using in Petit Cup. With access to its signature move, Glare, Ekans is the most consistent way of paralyzing Ground-type threats, most notably Diglett, which makes it valuable support. It also has fairly decent offensive options, including QuakeSlide coverage, Mega Drain, and Body Slam. To top it all off, Ekans also has access to Wrap alongside Glare, which can potentially be game-ending in Game Boy formats.

<p>
However, Ekans is bogged down by a myriad of issues. For starters, its bulk is very middling and not helped at all by its typing. Combined with its average Speed, Pokémon like Abra and Diglett can abuse it quite well. Its HP is also low enough to the point it requires at least two levels invested to get out of Dragon Rage 2HKO range, which not all teams can necessarily afford. As if this wasn't enough, Ekans has no STAB to speak of outside of the very weak Poison Sting, which heavily limits its offensive prowess, despite its otherwise great movepool. Glare itself is also an inconsistent move, having only 75% accuracy, which makes attempting to paralyze Pokémon like Sandshrew a bit risky if it goes wrong. In addition, due to Ekans's Speed, Substitute can and will prevent Glare from working if the target is faster. Due to these issues, Ekans has issues fitting into the metagame despite its fairly positive traits.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Ekans should primarily be used for Glare; as such, it's a ubiquitous choice on most Ekans movesets. Rock Slide and Earthquake compliment each other almost perfectly in terms of coverage, allowing Ekans to hit almost the entire metagame for super-effective damage. Body Slam rounds out the moveset for spreading paralysis while dealing more damage than Rock Slide, covering potential Flying-type switch-ins and Exeggcute more effectively. Ekans should be at least L27 to stay out of 2HKO range from Dragon Rage at full health, allowing it to switch in and try to paralyze the target.

<p>
Ekans is fairly straightforward from a strategic standpoint. Ekans is a decent Pokémon in the early game by virtue of Glare alone, but its typing and bulk tend to make it risky. Once its counters have been removed, namely Pokémon like Abra, Ekans tends to shine. Once a team has been paralyzed, Ekans's job is done, and it should spend the rest of the game utilizing its coverage to deal as much damage as possible.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Wrap can be used alongside Glare for more effective use in Yellow Petit Cup, as well as its strong pivoting qualities. However, it also has utility in Stadium for cheesing a final Pokémon.
Mega Drain is also notable for helping Ekans fight off Geodude and Omanyte, while recovering vast amounts of HP in the process.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
 
 
 
<b>Abra: </b>Abra is an extremely big threat to Ekans, OHKOing it with Psychic even with maximum level difference. The only way Ekans can win is if Abra has been paralyzed on switch-in after taking chip damage, where its Earthquake can deal up to 80% damage. Generally though, this is inconsistent at best. The only option Ekans has once Abra is in, unless it's paralyzed, is to switch out.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Exeggcute: </b>Exeggcute's bulk makes it near-impossible for Ekans to break through, with Ekans dealing a maximum of 20.4% to it with Body Slam. In return, Exeggcute can 2HKO Ekans with Psychic. Should Exeggcute be particularly damaged, it can potentially OHKO Ekans with Explosion if there's a high enough level difference.<br><br>
 
 
 
<b>Ground-types: </b>Despite being the purpose of Ekans, it remains risky to attempt to paralyze them with Glare due to its typing. It will take super-effective damage from their Earthquakes, which can incapacitate it. For instance, Sandshrew's Earthquake at L25 will OHKO an L27 Ekans almost 80% of the time. Due to this issue, Ekans will tend to only paralyze these threats switching in.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Substitute: </b>In similar fashion to Paras and its Spore, Ekans has issues landing Glare if the target has Substitute. However, this issue runs deeper than simply not being fast enough to do it, as Ekans also has poor damage output that <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> be boosted through moves like Swords Dance. As a result, not only does it have issues breaking Substitutes used by bulky threats, it also can't land its paralysis through it.
