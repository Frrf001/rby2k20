<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Zubat has a fairly unique typing, along with some interesting traits over the other Flying-types. Its access to Mega Drain lets it come in on an Earthquake from Geodude and try to get some damage in. On top of this, Zubat also has access to Confuse Ray, a 100% accurate confusion move, allowing it to serve as an anti-lead in some respects. As a result, Zubat technically has a niche in the format. 
</p>
 
 
<p>
The problem? Zubat is awful. With middling stats across the board, crippling weaknesses to Psychic-type and Electric-type attacks, and a horrific movepool for good measure, there is little to no reason to use it over other Flying-types when other Pokémon can fill the roles it wants to fill. To make matters even worse, the two unique moves Zubat has are rendered useless by Substitute. There are very few Pokémon out there that Zubat can actually check, with those threatened often being capable of muscling past through coverage anyway.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This is the best Zubat can pull from its movepool to give itself a conceivable niche. The level provided takes Zubat out of 2HKO range from Dragon Rage. Confuse Ray and Mega Drain give Zubat unique qualities over other Flying-types, and should not be put down when considering it for this reason. Confuse Ray lets Zubat serve as a decently effective anti-lead, potentially allowing it to get a Substitute off to stay in. Mega Drain compliments Double-Edge, Zubat's main attack, by allowing it to 2HKO Geodude and recover all health spent on the Substitute. Substitute allows Zubat to dodge paralysis from slow users like Paras and Magnemite.

<p>
In the odd event Zubat enters the battlefield, it should be in the early game. This is to remove Geodude as soon as possible, enabling your Electric-type threats. This also allows Zubat to thwart slower leads with Confuse Ray. Like on Mt. Moon, Zubat should be an annoying Pokémon to fight. It's best to have Zubat pick off weakened foes later—after it's been forced out—with Double-Edge, as it can avoid the recoil with Stadium's mechanics.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Zubat can have its level raised to 28 or above to use Wing Attack, allowing it to damage Grass-types more effectively, 2HKO Paras, and hit Gastly for some minor damage. However, the utility generally ends there, as it deals less damage than Double-Edge in every other instance. In addition, fitting this onto a set can be a bit difficult, as all of Zubat's moves have fairly important purposes.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
<p>
Zubat is generally beaten by a lot of the format; if its opponent isn't a Grass-type, it'll probably do very poorly. However, there are two very standout ways to beat Zubat.
</p>
 
<p>
 
 
 
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly's Thunderbolt deals immense damage to Zubat, 2HKOing it. In addition, Gastly is faster and often carries Substitute, invalidating the two things Zubat is used for. Gastly can also threaten Zubat with sleep from Hypnosis.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Electric-types: </b>Zubat has issues damaging Electric-types, especially since it's nearly OHKOed by any of Pikachu, Voltorb, or Magnemite's Thunderbolts. As a result, using Double-Edge in retaliation without a KO could even lead to Zubat KOing itself.<br><br>
