<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Omanyte has a fairly good typing which allows it to serve as a hard counter to the Fire-types of the metagame, most notably Charmander and Growlithe. With a sky high Special stat for the format, as well as being tied with Geodude and Shellder for highest Defense in the format, Omanyte doubles as an excellent tank. A STAB Surf from Omanyte really hurts, even 2HKOing Gastly with sufficient level difference. As such, Omanyte is a very difficult Pokémon to switch into if you aren't able to remove it right after. However, its HP is quite low—enough to the point it's 2HKOed by Dragon Rage without level investment—so care must be taken against those types of Pokémon. In addition, Omanyte is the 5th slowest Pokémon in the format, mandating paralysis support to gain a foothold. Should it be accommodated for, however, Omanyte can be a devastating threat.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This set makes the best use of Omanyte's tanking capabilities. The given level keeps Omanyte out of 2HKO range, but the investment can be increased to at least L29 to guarantee a 2HKO on L25 Gastly with Surf. Surf and Blizzard provide Omanyte with almost unresisted coverage, only being beaten out by other Water-types. With Reflect up, Omanyte is a very difficult Pokémon to defeat physically; for example, Sandshrew's Earthquake only has a ~6% chance to 3HKO through Reflect, while allowing Omanyte to strike back with an OHKO from Surf. Rest gives Omanyte good staying power in tandem with Reflect, by virtue of its already good bulk. However, it can be difficult to wake up should there be a strong Special attacker around. 
</p>
 
<p>
Omanyte is slow, so if it switches in normally, it will likely have to take two hits before attacking. Ergo, it's not good at actually countering Pokémon if they aren't either paralyzed or Fire-types. This means two things: Omanyte should be given paralysis support to succeed, and it's good practice to bring it in mid to late-game once its checks have been crippled in some way. Omanyte should try to avoid paralysis to ensure this late-game strategy succeeds.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Body Slam can be used to allow Omanyte to set up paralysis for itself while hitting Water-types, but the damage is middling at best and Kabuto tends to run that kind of set more effectively. Double Team is also an option to use in conjunction with Rest, but Omanyte is slow and thus has more opportunities to be hit before the evasion becomes favourable.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly can 2HKO Omanyte with Thunderbolt if both are at L25, but with level difference Omanyte can definitely take Gastly down instead, with Surf 2HKOing it if there's at least a 4-level difference between the two. This opportunity is few and far between though, as many Gastly are L27 so that they can use Hypnosis.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Bulky Water-types: </b>While Omanyte is equally—if not more—bulky than most Water-types, it has issues breaking through others due to its coverage being resisted by them. As a result, Pokémon such as Shellder and Squirtle wall it pretty well. In addition to this, Goldeen in particular is a big threat due to its access to Horn Drill, which can outright ignore Omanyte's bulk. It should also be noted that unlike other Water-types except Kabuto, Omanyte takes neutral damage from Water-type attacks, which often means it will be taking more damage than it's dishing out.<br><br>
 
 
 
<b>Bulbasaur: </b>Bulbasaur can OHKO Omanyte with Razor Leaf with relative ease, but can't switch in if paralyzed due to Blizzard 2HKOing it. Bellsprout can also attempt to beat Omanyte with Mega Drain, but it's noticeably weaker and frailer than Bulbasaur.<br><br>
