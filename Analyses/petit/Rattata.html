<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
 
 
<p>
Rattata, while it initially looks poor, has its viability skyrocket with the existence of Focus Energy, increasing its critical hit rate to just over 60%. A critical hit Body Slam from Rattata will 2HKO most of the metagame, including the fairly bulky Clefairy, making it difficult to switch into. Rattata is also quite quick, outspeeding Spearow and Charmander. However, it's outsped by some notable threats, such as Gastly and Abra. In addition, Rattata's Attack stat and damage output on their own is only ok, only dealing a bit more than Eevee overall; it's extremely reliant on getting those critical hits to function. Rattata's bulk is also atrocious, leading it to getting effortlessly 2HKOed by most threats in the metagame. This also makes it extremely vulnerable to paralysis, as it exposes its pitiful bulk. Without Focus Energy, Rattata is mostly outclassed by Spearow.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
 
 
<p>
 
This is about all that Rattata can muster. Focus Energy is what gives Rattata its niche, and it should be used if you plan on bringing Rattata to a game. Body Slam is its strongest attack without drawbacks, paralyzing threats and 2HKOing most of the metagame on a critical hit. BubbleBeam will ideally OHKO Geodude, but that's its only purpose; Body Slam deals more to even Diglett. If OHKOing Geodude isn't necessary, Blizzard can be used instead. Substitute protects Rattata from paralysis and lets it take a hit, potentially giving it an opportunity to safely set up Focus Energy.

<p>
Rattata is extremely frail and requires a lot of support to be able to get a good sweep. Paralyzing threats faster than it, such as Abra, Pikachu, and Poliwag is critical if you intend to succeed with Rattata. Ideally, Gastly should be removed as well, as Rattata only 4HKOes it with critical hit Thunderbolts. The best time to bring Rattata in is on a passive threat that allows it to set up Focus Energy, such as a Pokémon that has used Rest (e.g. Exeggcute). This can give it ample opportunity to set up a Substitute as well, which can well be a win.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
Quick Attack can potentially allow Rattata to hit its faster threats, 2HKOing Abra if both hits are critical hits. However, fitting this onto a set is fairly difficult, as Rattata needs coverage to not be walled by Rock-types. Dig can be used alongside Substitute to try and safely hit Gastly and Rock-types, but it takes multiple turns to set up properly, giving ample opportunity for counterplay. In addition, Gastly, the main target, is OHKOed only on a critical hit. Double-Edge can be used over Body Slam for more damage, but the recoil makes Rattata easier to revenge kill than it already is, and the lack of paralysis makes Rattata easier to switch into.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
 
 
<p>
 
 
 
<b>Gastly: </b>Gastly takes virtually nothing from Rattata's coverage while being immune to Body Slam. It's usually 4HKOed by critical hit Blizzard, which is the most reliable way for Rattata to potentially win the interaction. Otherwise, Dig OHKOes it on a critical hit, but is generally unreliable. Generally, this matchup is very one-sided.<br><br>
 
<b>Paralysis Inducers: </b>When faced with Pikachu or Voltorb, the fastest Thunder Wave users in the format, Rattata is very likely going to be forced out, forcing it to set up Focus Energy again later. If paralyzed, Rattata becomes slow and frail and can't really function at all.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Faster Pokémon: </b>Rattata is very easily revenge killed by Pokémon like Diglett and Abra due to its fragility and awkward Speed tier. This often means Rattata will either be forced out after a KO, or it'll end up being a one-for-one trade. Rattata can win these interactions, but it requires it being at full health and possibly getting a critical hit.<br><br>
 
 
<b>Omanyte and Kabuto: </b>While Rattata can 2HKO both of these threats with a critical hit Thunderbolt, Omanyte and Kabuto can win the interaction in every other instance, both possessing 2HKOs with Surf. As a result, Rattata's consistency comes back to bite it here. In addition, if Rattata is paralyzed, it can't win against these at all.<br><br>
