<h1>Introduction</h1> 

 

<p> 

Charmander sits in a fair Speed tier while having access to several powerful moves, including Slash, Dragon Rage, and Fire Blast. As a result, it's a very serious threat if it's able to get in and can definitely sweep opposing teams given the chance. Even without Slash, the potentially higher damage from a Swords Dance set remains a threat, making it very difficult to actually wall Charmander. Dragon Rage is also going to 3HKO many lower-levelled Pokémon, or just finish them off after the first hit. Charmander has a lot of potential build variety, making it a flexible pick for many Petit Cup teams thanks to its sheer damage output. 

</p> 

<p> 

Charmander does struggle sometimes, though. If paralyzed, it tends to struggle from then on, no longer outspeeding important threats and exposing its weak defensive stats. As a result, carrying ways to get rid of paralysis is helpful. Its typing also does it no favours, further emphasizing its fragility and leaving it vulnerable to the powerful Earthquake. Pokémon such as Sandshrew are capable of exploiting this weakness quite well, though they should be wary of a burn from Fire Blast or massive chip from Dragon Rage. It's also one of few Pokémon to be 2HKOed by Dragon Rage itself, making its matchup against other users, such as Magikarp, much less in its favour. Its Speed is also only average, with threats such as Gastly, Abra, Diglett, and Poliwag all beating it out. As a result, Charmander often demands extensive paralysis support to ensure it can get in and leave a giant dent in the opposing team.

<h1>Sets</h1> 

<h3>Slash</h3>

Level: 30 <br> 

- Slash <br> 

- Fire Blast <br> 

- Dragon Rage <br> 

- Submission <br> 

</set></p> 

 

<h3>Set Details</h3> 

<p> 

This is the standard set you can expect on an L30 Charmander, as this is where it gets access to Slash. Ergo, the level number tends to reveal the set to the opponent. Slash is a great move for Charmander, allowing it to hit through Reflect users while maintaining solid physical damage output. Oftentimes, a Slash or two and a subsequent Dragon Rage will confirm a KO on many Pokémon from full health. Fire Blast is immensely powerful, KOing Exeggcute if it's taken any amount of chip damage. Dragon Rage deals a guaranteed 40 damage to any Pokémon, which makes it very difficult to wall Charmander; only the niche Jigglypuff can escape a 3HKO, which requires level investment. Submission gives Charmander a guaranteed 2HKO on L25 Clefairy and Eevee, though level investment can affect this; regardless, it deals the most damage.

<p> 

Charmander is best brought in late-game when its checks have been heavily chipped and/or paralyzed. Sometimes Charmander can win off the bat just by spamming Dragon Rage. If it doesn't, Charmander's other powerful attacks tend to do the trick. However, Charmander can be brought in against a slower threat it can counter, such as Exeggcute, to try and force damage on the opponent instead. Charmander should stay wary of Poliwag if it's been revealed in Team Preview, as it's faster than Charmander and 2HKOs it with Surf.

<h3>Swords Dance</h3> 

<p><set> 

Charmander <br> 

Level: 27 <br> 

- Swords Dance <br> 

- Fire Blast <br> 

- Body Slam / Dragon Rage <br> 

- Submission / Dragon Rage <br> 

</set></p> 

 

<h3>Set Details</h3> 

 

<p> 

This set takes a different approach to Charmander, instead focusing on its potential damage output through physical attacks. After a Swords Dance, Charmander's counters become noticeably less effective; for instance, Poliwag is now 2HKOed by Body Slam with a threat of paralysis to boot. A Clefairy below L28 is also favourably OHKOed by Submission. Body Slam is a great move for Charmander, as the chance of paralysis makes switching in any Pokémon that's not Normal-type a dangerous endeavour. Combined with Submission, this coverage is only bested by Gastly. However, Dragon Rage can be used over either to boost Charmander's immediate threat level; note that it 2HKOs Geodude should it lack level investment. However, the Slash set is usually better in this case, as the move compression leaves it less open to bulkier threats that can hit it back. The level on this set is quite flexible, and can be tweaked according to a team's needs, and even be used on ace teams utilizing an L30. However, L27 and above is recommended to escape the 2HKO from Dragon Rage. 

</p> 

<p> 

Swords Dance Charmander is a bit more difficult to use than Slash Charmander, as it lacks immediate power outside of Fire Blast. As such, finding opportunities to set up should come down to easing it in against more passive threats, such as Jigglypuff, Bellsprout, and Oddish. Vulpix is also a notable Pokémon that Charmander can set up against, due to its resistance to Fire Blast. However, Growlithe and other Charmander should be avoided due to their access to Dragon Rage. Using Charmander against opponents using Rest is also an excellent opportunity, especially if it's been predicted. Once the opportunity to set up has been found, Charmander's sweep should be fairly straightforward. 

</p> 

 

<h2>Other Options</h2> 

<p> 

The first move of note would be Counter, which is excellent for punishing Pokémon for trying to paralyze Charmander with Body Slam. This helps against Vulpix, which often uses Body Slam to break past Charmander. This is especially helpful in Yellow Petit Cup, where its mechanics can be abused in conjunction with Charmander's excellent threat level, forcing out threats to score more damage. In this case, replacing Submission is recommended.<br><br> 

 

Substitute allows Charmander to block status, alleviating its issues with paralysis. This can be utilized alongside Swords Dance to set up a sweep, though Charmander will usually have to give up Submission, which gives it major issues with Geodude.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2> 

<p> 

Charmander's matchups change quite a bit based on level difference and the set its using. As such, it's best to look at its level in Team Preview, as only L30 Charmander can use Slash. As a result, any Charmander under L30 is very likely to be using the Swords Dance set, and any L30 Charmander may be using Slash. Using this information to your advantage is pivotal in preventing a Charmander sweep. 

</p> 

<p> 

<b>Sandshrew: </b>Sandshrew can OHKO any Charmander below L29 with its Earthquake, without any boosts, at L25. Its bulk also enables it to take any hit Charmander throws at it, though it's 2HKOed by Fire Blast with a threat of a Burn to boot, so it should only switch in if Charmander has been paralyzed.<br><br> 

 

<b>Poliwag: </b>Even an L25 Poliwag can outspeed and 2HKO Charmander with Surf, regardless of level investment. However, it can't switch in on L30 Slash, nor any +2 Body Slam from Charmander. As a result, its only point of entry is catching a Charmander using Swords Dance, a KO, a Wrap switch, or a very well-predicted Fire Blast. Even then, Poliwag is going to take severe damage pulling this off. Poliwag can also threaten with sleep, but Hypnosis is its only way of doing this, and it's notoriously inconsistent in Stadium.<br><br> 

 

<b>Squirtle and Horsea: </b>Squirtle's bulk allows it to handle Slash Charmander quite well, as it's never 2HKOed by Slash with any amount of level investment and can 2HKO with Surf in return. In addition, it takes minimal damage from Fire Blast. Horsea does this in a very similar way and takes even less damage from Fire Blast. However, Swords Dance Charmander can break both of these should it get a +2 Body Slam in. As a result, these Pokémon should only be used once the Charmander set has been revealed, often through its level.<br><br> 

 

<b>Diglett: </b>Diglett effortlessly outspeeds Charmander and can 2HKO it with Earthquake even at L25. However, it has a small chance to be OHKOed by Fire Blast if the Charmander is L30 in this case. To guarantee it survives, it must be L26, though even then, burns can always be a disheartening thing to see. Due to its fragility, however, Diglett can't switch in and must only be used to try and revenge kill Charmander.<br><br> 

 

<b>Gastly: </b>L27 Gastly is a decent way to deal with Swords Dance Charmander. It's capable of handily taking a Fire Blast, and threatening it with either Sleep or heavy damage with Thunderbolt. However, it's 2HKOed by Dragon Rage unless it's at least L29, which gives Charmander some wiggle room to beat it out. In addition, it needs a lot more level investment to beat an L30 Charmander, which is much more capable of taking it down with Fire Blast.<br><br> 

 

<b>Geodude: </b>Geodude, being the only Rock-type in the format, is capable of taking a Fire Blast, Slash, or Body Slam from Charmander just fine. However, it's 2HKOed by +2 Submission and 2HKOed by Dragon Rage unless it's at least L27. In addition, at L27, Geodude's chance of OHKOing with Earthquake is just 35.9%. As a result, Geodude is only really going to revenge kill Charmander in context.<br><br>
