<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Charizard is a strong late-game cleaner in Nintendo Cup 99 by virtue of good coverage and the ability to run a variety of sets. The Flying-type allows Charizard to act as counterplay to Fissure, or Ground-type coverage in general. Charizard's great Speed tier enables it to tie with Pokemon such as Tentacruel, Ninetales and Raichu, all of which are threatened by Earthquake. It also serves as an amazing check to Haunter, with Earthquake being a guaranteed 2HKO. Charizard also has access to Slash, which lets it break through Reflect sets more easily. Access to Counter also enables Charizard to sting the common Persian. Charizard serves as a good teammate to Slowbro, as it counters Victreebel, one of its main checks.</p>


<p>Charizard isn't without flaws, though. While it can be varied, it lacks immediate power without Slash, which can make its coverage weaker. As a result, attempting to use Swords Dance at the wrong time makes it very easily countered. It suffers from a horrendous defensive typing, often leading to its sweep being cut short by Pokemon such as Rhydon or Sandslash. Electabuzz is also a concern, outspeeding Charizard and dealing heavy damage with STAB Thunderbolt. However, it dislikes coming in on Earthquake. Slowbro also hard counters it, turning it into setup fodder.</p>



<h1>Sets</h1>



<h3>Swords Dance</h3>



<p><set>

Charizard <br>

Level: 50 <br>

- Swords Dance <br>

- Fire Blast <br>

- Earthquake <br>

- Body Slam / Submission <br>

</set></p>



<h3>Set Details</h3>



<p>

The standard Charizard set. Swords Dance allows Charizard to threaten a significant portion of the metagame using Earthquake and its chosen secondary coverage. Fire Blast lets Charizard counter Victreebel and the uncommon lead Venomoth. The last slot depends on what the user wants out of Charizard. Earthquake hits almost all of Charizard's checks on switch-in, such as Electabuzz, usually OHKOing them at +2. Rhydon is also 2HKOed by it. Body Slam works as neutral coverage that can spread paralysis; this also gives it a move to hit Moltres and Mr. Mime with. Submission can be used for a chance to OHKO Persian at +2, and 2HKO Clefable.

<h3>Slash</h3>



<p><set>

Charizard <br>

Level: 50 <br>

- Slash <br>

- Earthquake <br>

- Fire Blast <br>

- Counter <br>

</set></p>



<h3>Set Details</h3>



<p>

Should the user want immediate power, Charizard can eschew Swords Dance for Slash, which also opens up a moveslot. While Slash deals just a bit less than Body Slam, it allows Charizard to take on Moltres and Mr. Mime without always being resisted. It also allows Charizard to have a much better matchup against Reflect users, who are usually more fragile. Earthquake still 2HKOs most of its threats, with Raichu, Haunter and Electabuzz absolutely not wanting to switch in on it. Counter is used to dispatch Persian, as well as Pokemon trying to use Body Slam to fish for paralysis. This set is noticeably weaker to Rhydon, with Charizard often being forced out.

<h2>Other Options</h2>



<p>

Fire Spin can be used alongside Body Slam paralysis, and gives Charizard pivoting potential. However, it has issues with consistency. Substitute can also be used to fight status leads such as Venomoth, since Stadium allows Substitute to block status. This can also help Charizard get consecutive Swords Dance boosts safely.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>

Charizard has very few true counters in Nintendo Cup '99. Its main issue is switching in to make use of its difficult-to-counter nature.

<b>Slowbro and Poliwrath:</b> Slowbro resists everything Charizard can throw at it, except Slash or Body Slam, which don't deal that much damage. The latter requires a +6 Charizard to even score a 2HKO. Slowbro also serves as one of the easiest methods of paralyzing Charizard, which neuters its threat potential.<br><br>
<b>Dewgong:</b> If Charizard has taken any amount of damage, Dewgong is very likely to KO it with Blizzard. While it's technically 2HKOed by +2 Submission, Charizard has an extremely low chance to take the incoming Blizzard.<br><br>
<b>Cloyster:</b> Cloyster ignores Charizard's physical attacks and 2HKOs with Blizzard. However, +2 Submission from Charizard has a 67.5% chance to 2HKO.<br><br>
<b>Sandslash:</b> Sandslash takes neutral damage from all of Charizard's coverage and can 2HKO with Rock Slide, or OHKO at +2. Fire Blast can 2HKO ~91% of the time, though.<br><br>
<b>Rhydon:</b> Rhydon can come in on a predicted Fire Blast or Body Slam and OHKO with Rock Slide. However, it's 2HKOed by Earthquake, meaning a switch-in is very risky.<br><br>
<b>Electabuzz:</b> If Charizard isn't at +2, Electabuzz can come in and try to 2HKO with Thunderbolt. It hates being hit with Earthquake, though, which 2HKOs it as well. Electabuzz can also try to paralyze it.<br><br>
<b>Omastar:</b> In a similar vein to how Omastar counters Moltres, it can try the same on Charizard. It's only 3HKOed by an unboosted Earthquake, and has potential to OHKO Charizard with Hydro Pump.<br><br>
<b>Mr. Mime:</b> Mr. Mime has a favorable chance to 2HKO Charizard with Thunderbolt, and often uses Reflect to stave off its physical attacks. However, it has issues dealing with the Slash set due to reliance on Reflect. <br><br>
<b>Moltres:</b> Moltres completely stonewalls Charizard if it lacks Body Slam or Slash. If it has Reflect, Charizard has further issues breaking through.
