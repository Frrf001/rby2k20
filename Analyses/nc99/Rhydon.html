<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Substitute can be used to prevent status and have a better matchup against Seismic Toss users. However, you're likely removing Body Slam or Horn Drill for this, which are far more valuable for dealing with Rhydon's checks, including the notoriously powerful Slowbro.
