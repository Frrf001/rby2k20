<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Hypnosis, while inconsistent, is still a valid choice to support your team with Sleep. Body Slam can be used to be more physically focused while spreading paralysis, but this leads to either a worse Persian or Haunter matchup, as you'll need to remove Submission or Psychic for it. This is also why Blizzard, while a good option on paper, isn't favoured.
