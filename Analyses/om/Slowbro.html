<h1>Nintendo Cup 99</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Slowbro is among the best Pokémon in the Nintendo Cup '99 format, commanding a great deal of respect from the rest of the format. Capable of walling many Pokémon out through its set of resistances, Slowbro is frequently seen invalidating many of the less viable Pokémon in the format. It's also only 3HKOed by Persian's Slash while having a very favorable chance to KO with a boosted Psychic. After even one Amnesia, Slowbro is capable of blowing weakened teams away with a volley of Psychics. Few Pokémon can stand up to Slowbro after one Amnesia, and those that do are some of the most omnipresent Pokémon in the format. As if this wasn't enough, Slowbro is one of the few Pokémon in the format that are only 5HKOed by Seismic Toss, further bolstering Slowbro's strengths. Once its checks are removed, the game is very likely over.</p>

<p>However, Slowbro is not without weaknesses. Being a slow threat, Slowbro is vulnerable to pretty much any OHKO move in the format, plus Blizzard. As such, every turn spent in front of an OHKO-using threat such as Rhydon or Rapidash can potentially lead to an early death, making all setup worthless. It is also very vulnerable to partial trapping, with Pokémon such as Moltres or Tentacruel eager to exploit this in hopes of at least cheesing it out. Pokémon such as Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu are also omnipresent specifically as checks to Slowbro, attempting to snag a 2HKO or 3HKO with Thunder or Thunderbolt. As such, most teams carrying Slowbro will carry checks to these Pokémon, such as Rhydon and Victreebel. Slowbro also requires careful use, as while it has staying power, it can take heavy damage from its checks, necessitating it to be at full health to remain reliable. Abusing Wrap switch-ins is a valid way to bring Slowbro in to alleviate this, so Pokémon such as Ninetales can be good partners.</p>

<h1>Sets</h1>
<h3>Amnesia</h3>
<p><set>
Slowbro <br>
- Amnesia <br>
- Thunder Wave / Rest <br>
- Psychic <br>
- Earthquake / Surf <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
<p>
This is the standard Slowbro set, with a simple premise: come in on a threat that it can wall, sit back and set up Amnesia. Once it's done, Slowbro can blow away the opposing team with Psychic, though care should be taken to not take too much damage. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to get KOs more easily, though Rest can be used to block sleep instead with the "Stadium" Sleep Clause in mind. Earthquake is carried to ensure Electabuzz, Haunter, and Raichu can't come in for free, though Surf can be used for dual STAB if this isn't a concern.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>
Ice Beam can be used to attempt to get a freeze on opposing Slowbro, which is a fairly common mirror a player will see in Nintendo Cup '99. However, this will often eat up the fourth slot, leaving Slowbro without an option against its typical checks. Slowbro can also use Fire Blast to fish for burns, which can then be used to pad Slowbro's bulk. However, it generally doesn't deal more damage than Psychic, leaving it as a dead move in many situations. Fissure could also be used alongside paralysis support to cheese OHKOs, but this is generally inconsistent and takes away Slowbro's general consistency.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
<ul>
<br>Slowbro has no safe counters, especially after an Amnesia is up. However, it does have checks that demand respect.

<li>Victreebel - Victreebel outspeeds Slowbro and can rip through it with Razor Leaf, ignoring its Amnesia boosts. It can also sleep it with Sleep Powder. However, it absolutely cannot switch in safely due to the threat of Psychic.</li>

<li>Raichu and Electabuzz - Both of these threats can 2HKO Slowbro with Thunderbolt, but can struggle one-on-one if it's got an Amnesia up. Thunder Wave can potentially disrupt it as well. However, Slowbro's Earthquake is a confirmed 2HKO on both of these threats, meaning they cannot safely come in. </li>

<li>Haunter - Haunter is less consistent than the above threats, but has a 2HKO on Slowbro with Thunder. It can also threaten Slowbro with sleep from Hypnosis to make this easier. However, like Raichu and Electabuzz, it is 2HKOed by Earthquake. </li>

<li>Kadabra - Kadabra can Recover off Amnesia-boosted Psychics while being capable of damaging Slowbro in the process with Seismic Toss. However, +6 Amnesia allows Slowbro to outweigh Recover damage and eventually KO it. On the bright side, Kadabra can likely stall a majority of Psychic's PP, which is Slowbro's only special attack on most sets. Thus, it can technically serve as a way to neuter the threat of Slowbro.</li>

<li>OHKO Moves & Freezing - Slowbro is among the slowest Pokémon, meaning it is also vulnerable to pretty much every OHKO move in the game as well. Even Rhydon can potentially land a Horn Drill to take it down, which usually requires paralysis against normal threats. Pokémon such as Lapras can also fish for Blizzard freezes instead of Horn Drill when paralyzed. Given Blizzard's 30% freeze rate in the format, this is an added risk to Slowbro usage.</li>

<li>Substitute - While not a clear-cut way to beat Slowbro, many threats have a better time against it when not paralyzed. Setting up Substitute against an attempted Thunder Wave can gain a lot of momentum against it, often forcing Slowbro to either switch out or try to stall. However, many partners attempt to spread paralysis with Slowbro in mind, which makes this less of an issue.</li>
