<h1>Nintendo Cup 98</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the 33-Pokémon format, Exeggutor stands out as one of the best Pokémon available. While it may be without its beloved Powders, Exeggutor still remains a strong, bulky threat with the ability to trade with Explosion or limit recovery with Hypnosis. Exeggutor is a good counter to Jolteon, one of the most popular Pokémon in the format. This is because Jolteon doesn't learn Pin Missile due to level restrictions, limiting its coverage options. Exeggutor also checks many of the other faster threats in the format, such as Alakazam, Gengar, and Dugtrio. Overall, Exeggutor is a reliable check to the Speed demons of the format, and serves as a staple on many teams.</p>

<p>However, like many Pokémon forced to be L30, Exeggutor has some downsides. The loss of the Powders forces it to only use Hypnosis, which with the different sleep mechanics makes usage questionable. The lack of Stun Spore is especially notable, as it can no longer paralyze Tauros or Starmie, the latter of which walls it relatively easily. Exeggutor also has issues against Jynx, who has a faster and more accurate sleep move in Lovely Kiss, as well as deal significant damage with STAB Blizzard. All in all, Exeggutor has received significant blows to its consistency, but still demands respect from its peers.</p>

<h2>Sets</h2>

Exeggutor <br>
- Psychic <br>
- Explosion <br>
- Double-Edge / Hypnosis <br>
- Mega Drain / Hypnosis <br>
</set></p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
<p>
Psychic is here for STAB and to reliably hit almost the whole format. Explosion is primarily here to trade with Chansey, though it can be used in other contexts to blow a hole in the opposing team. Double-Edge will 3HKO Alakazam and Jynx, which helps it a lot should it be used as a lead. Mega Drain can be used to hit Golem and Starmie while getting a source of recovery. However, Hypnosis can be used instead to prevent an Pokémon such as Chansey or Starmie from using their recovery moves.
</p>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>
Toxic + Leech Seed can be used if your aim is to form a wincon against an opponent's last Pokémon, though this takes up two valuable moveslots and isn't always helpful. Egg Bomb can be used for having the same base power as Double-Edge without recoil, but the accuracy makes it less than favorable. Hyper Beam can also be used to KO Alakazam and Jynx at a higher HP range in exchange for consistency.
</p>

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
<ul>
<br>
<li>Lapras - Lapras doesn't care much for Exeggutor's damage output and will 2HKO with Blizzard, and it isn't even close to being OHKOed by Explosion, making it one of the safest ways of forcing Exeggutor out available. It can also threaten to sleep it with Sing should it be using it, making it a more difficult opponent to switch into.</li>
<li>Starmie - Starmie is similar to Lapras in that it can KO Exeggutor easily with Blizzard, but often takes a more defensive approach with Recover that makes it even harder for Exeggutor to fight it off. An Explosion trade from full health against Starmie is only an unfavorable roll. Overall, these situations are less than favorable for Exeggutor.</li>
<li>Jynx - Especially in a lead situation, Jynx poses a massive threat to Exeggutor. It can choose to either 2HKO Exeggutor with Blizzard, or get a faster, more accurate Sleep on it with Lovely Kiss. This situation will usually end poorly for the Exeggutor player, no matter what choice is made.</li>
<li>Chansey - Chansey can take Exeggutor's attacks with ease, forcing it to try and trade through Explosion, or switch out. However, it does fear Hypnosis if Sleep Clause isn't in effect.</li>
</ul>
