<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Rhydon is a critical piece of the RBY OU metagame, thanks to a massive Attack stat and unique typing. Its STAB Earthquake is among the most powerful physical attacks to be hit by in the game, with no drawbacks bogging it down either. This makes it extremely hard to switch into for standard teams, and while initially quite slow, Rhydon can be extremely powerful against teams that have become paralyzed during drawn-out games. With Thunder Wave support from Pokémon such as Chansey and Jolteon, this can be a fairly easy feat to set up. Even without support, it can still outspeed Slowbro and Snorlax, allowing it to force damage on them. Rhydon's typing provides it with good defensive utility, with players being able to switch it in on moves such as Hyper Beam and Explosion to gain a significant advantage. With the lack of Team Preview, this becomes a looming threat that players have to always consider in the early game. One notable application is coming in during a Tauros mirror, usually after two Body Slams, where the opponent will often try to Hyper Beam for a KO. Rhydon can then use Earthquake to take the opponent out guaranteed. Rhydon's typing allows it to switch in on Electric-type moves—notably Thunder Wave—and threaten the opponent with a heavy hit. This is critical against opponents such as Chansey and Alakazam, which will often try to spread paralysis early.</p>
 
<p>Rhydon and Golem have often vied for OU team placements, and for good reason: they're both pretty different at achieving their roles. Rhydon has more bulk, while Golem is faster and has the second-strongest self-KO move in the game, only behind Snorlax's Self-Destruct. However, Rhydon usually ends up winning out. This is because it has access to 103-HP Substitutes, giving it a much better matchup against Reflect Chansey variants. In addition, Rhydon's higher Attack value ends up giving it some key damage ranges, such as a guaranteed 2HKO on Chansey should it not get Reflect up in time, which is quite achievable if it switches in while paralyzed. Golem has little reward for the increased Speed, as it only gets to outspeed Rhydon, at least when considering the OU threats. Explosion also encourages Golem to blow up fairly early into a game, when its typing encourages it to stick around for longer. Due to these factors, Rhydon is greatly favored in RBY OU.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
This set has been used for decades, and for good reason: it's hard to argue against. Rhydon's Earthquake is the stuff of nightmares, dealing immense damage to anything with no drawbacks to speak of. Few Pokémon want to switch in on it, and if paralyzed, some will even be KOed before they can even move. Rock Slide is primarily used to further Rhydon's ability to counter Zapdos, but it can be useful against threats such as Cloyster. Body Slam allows Rhydon to support itself with paralysis, which can make the Exeggutor, Alakazam and Starmie match-ups significantly more volatile. This is very helpful when hitting opponents switching in, since Rhydon then has a significantly higher threat factor. Substitute is pivotal against Seismic Toss users such as Alakazam and Chansey, with its 103 HP making it survive. This gives Rhydon a free hit a lot of the time, especially against Reflect Chansey, who tends to not carry any damaging moves other than Seismic Toss. Rhydon can set up Substitute against opponents such as Jolteon and Zapdos, enabling it to get more free damage in. Rhydon can also fish for full paralysis on threats such as Starmie to try and get a Substitute with no damage, which can allow it to stay in and try to land the somewhat uncommon 2HKO—or even OHKO on a critical hit—with Earthquake.
 
Many players build teams around Rhydon, usually by providing it with heavy paralysis support. This has often led to Starmie being used to form the "MieDon" core, as they compensate for each other's weaknesses. Rhydon's ability to switch in on foes such as Zapdos gives Starmie some much-needed protection, while Starmie can also threaten many of the Special attackers of the format. Rhydon's incredible threat potential against paralyzed teams gives it immense reward for the support provided, by virtue of its massive damage output. Despite these advantages though, Rhydon kind of requires the support to be used well. Without paralysis, Rhydon tends to lose a lot of 1v1s against threats it can potentially beat, such as Exeggutor and Tauros. Its low Special stat makes it food for most Special attackers, and even coverage such as a Blizzard from Tauros can be deadly.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>
While deviating from the standard isn't quite recommended, changing Rhydon's moveset is possible. Usually, it's a toss-up between Rock Slide and Body Slam. In regards to dropping Rock Slide, Rhydon can win pretty handily against Zapdos in the first place, and outside of this, Rock Slide's coverage tends to be a bit specific. It's mainly used against Lapras and Cloyster, but these threats can be handled by teammates such as Starmie quite easily. In addition, the threats only hit by Rock Slide, such as Articuno and Moltres, are extremely rare in RBY OU. However, Rock Slide does enable Rhydon to 4HKO Exeggutor, even 2HKOing it from half health, which should not be ignored. Should Rock Slide be seen as a necessity on a team, Body Slam should be dropped. However, this makes match-ups such as Exeggutor and Starmie much worse, as Rhydon then becomes strictly reliant on teammates to spread paralysis for it. Substitute is droppable, but this makes the Reflect Chansey match-up significantly worse.
 
In terms of moves to use, Rest would be the first choice. This is a valuable source of recovery that can make Rhydon stick around for significantly longer, while removing full paralysis from the equation. Rhydon is difficult to reliably paralyze thanks to its typing, but this even makes Body Slam paralysis only a temporary measure. Rest's recovery also allows Rhydon to handle Zapdos much more effectively, as well as allowing Rhydon to be more aggressive against Reflect Chansey and no-coverage Snorlax. Reflect Chansey is of particular note, as Rhydon can burn Rest turns behind a Substitute if push comes to shove. Rhydon is very difficult to wake up, however, as many threats can take advantage of the free turns provided, most notably Tauros, who will force it out every time. Due to the amount of special attackers that threaten it, there isn't always a chance for Rhydon to wake up without some luck involved.
 
Leer is a somewhat notable option, allowing Rhydon to have a much better matchup against Reflect Chansey and Snorlax. This is normally run over Substitute. It can also generally increase Rhydon's already sky-high damage output, securing some solid KOs. However, switching out is a fair counter to this, and it can give faster Pokémon an opportunity to come in to force Rhydon out instead. With none of the usual damage tacked on switch-in that is to be expected of Rhydon, this provides opponents with opportunities to play around Rhydon's sweep attempts that usually aren't available. This adds inherent inconsistency to Rhydon's game plan in exchange for more raw power. In addition, while less consistent, just spamming Earthquake can potentially land a critical hit on Reflect Chansey and Snorlax, often leading to a KO outright. This also punishes switch-ins as usual.
 
Counter is viable for punishing Hyper Beam and Explosion usage, which can lead to a free KO in many situations. Switching in on Hyper Beam from threats such as Tauros and then countering it can deal significant damage. After an opponent's Explosion, bringing Counter Rhydon in to force the opponent's replacement out can even be a free KO in many instances.
 
BubbleBeam is also a decent option for the Rhydon mirror or Golem, dealing an upwards of 45% to both, which can lead to an Earthquake KO thereafter. This is notable for the high chance to drop the opponent's Speed, allowing Rhydon to not risk speed ties or being outsped by Golem. This is relevant against Exeggutor switch-ins, which can allow Rhydon to situationally win the interaction if it's already worn down. However, this should be used with Rock Slide for it to be reliable, as two Rock Slides deal 55% or more.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
<p>
 
<b>Exeggutor:</b> Exeggutor makes an excellent check, resisting Earthquake and not taking too much from Body Slam or Rock Slide, with them being a 5HKO and 4HKO respectively. However, Body Slam's paralysis can be devastating, leading to it having a much harder time checking Rhydon. Should it switch in when paralyzed, Rhydon has a good shot at reversing situation.
 
<b>Tauros:</b> Tauros can 2HKO Rhydon with Blizzard, and can survive two Earthquakes from full health. This is a pretty pressing situation, as Tauros often comes in to try and revenge kill once Rhydon KOs a Pokémon. Rhydon is usually forced out, as it can't do much to a non-paralyzed Tauros alone. This gives Tauros an incredible opening to start sweeping the opposing team, flipping the situation on the Rhydon user completely. Should the player's Tauros still be at full health, however, it is worth trying to get some damage in. To even duel Tauros as Rhydon, it is strongly recommended to have done something to it first.
 
<b>Cloyster:</b> Cloyster has a solid 1/3 chance to OHKO Rhydon with Blizzard, while not taking too much from Rhydon's STAB moves. Even if Rhydon decides to sit behind Substitute to avoid this, Clamp will still prevent it from moving, as it breaks the Substitute, allowing the effect to go off.
 
<b>Starmie:</b> An un-paralyzed Starmie can switch into and try to fight Rhydon. However, it's not free by any means. Starmie can be paralyzed by Body Slam in two ways: on switch-in or when trying to Recover. Both of these situations can lead to a complete reversal of the situation, giving Rhydon ample opportunity to try and cheese it with Substitute fishing.
 
<b>Chansey:</b> Chansey can switch in and Reflect against Rhydon, though this carries a good amount of risk, as Chansey is 2HKOed by Earthquake should it not be able to get the Reflect off. As such, Chansey cannot afford to be paralyzed when attempting this.
 
<b>Victreebel:</b> Victreebel can very easily OHKO Rhydon with Razor Leaf, but is 2HKOed by Earthquake. As such, Victreebell cannot afford to be paralyzed when switching in if it intends to try this. Victreebel is very threatening to teams using Rhydon should their Psychic-types be paralyzed.
 
<b>Slowbro:</b> Slowbro can set up Amnesia if it uses Reflect, and can OHKO with Surf regardless. To make matters worse, it can use Thunder Wave when forcing Rhydon out to ensure the switch-in comes in at a disadvantage. Slowbro does take a chunk coming in, however, which makes it easier to force a Rest.
 
<b>Lapras and Jynx:</b> Lapras effortlessly OHKOs Rhydon with Blizzard, but is 2HKOed by Rock Slide, so it cannot switch in. In addition, if paralyzed, the matchup becomes significantly worse for it. Jynx has a similar issue, only it's OHKOed by Rock Slide, making it an even worse match-up.
 
<b>Golem:</b> Golem outspeeds Rhydon and can 2HKO with Earthquake, but Rhydon does the same back. As a result, Golem cannot switch in. Golem is in an even worse situation if it's paralyzed or has its Speed dropped by BubbleBeam when coming in.
