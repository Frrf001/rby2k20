<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Onix finds itself mostly outclassed by the immensely stronger Rhydon and Golem, two competitors for its role. Onix is KO'd by virtually any super effective Special attack, and its low HP stat leaves it 3HKO'd by Seismic Toss and Night Shade. Furthermore, its terrible Attack stat leaves Onix’s explosions with pitiful damage output. To make any impact in a match, Onix must rely on what few tools it has that its competitors lack: base 70 Speed and Bind. This Speed tier allows it to Speed tie with Cloyster and Victreebel and outspeed Exeggutor. These qualities can be somewhat valuable, adding to its ability to control the momentum of the game with Bind. While still a gimmick, Onix does compress roles well, checking Electric-types and resisting Normal-types, and he is the only partial wrapper in the game with an immunity to Thunder Wave.

<h3>Set Details</h3>
<p>
 
Onix's Bind, combined with its high Speed, allows it to pivot or rack up chip damage, and is the main reason to use it over Rhydon or Golem. Earthquake is Onix's main STAB, and required to keep Gengar from walling it. Rock Slide is Onix's best means to punish Zapdos and Articuno, and helps support its partial role as a counter to those pokemon. While weak, Explosion can still be used to trade with a sufficiently weakened key threat. Some notable calcs for its non-crit explosion include 96% on Jynx, 91% on Alakazam, and a 70.9% on Chansey.
 
To effectively use Onix, you need to help it abuse its best tools in Bind and Explosion, and there are multiple ways of doing this. Using its teammates to spread paralysis, Onix freely Bind and Explode, letting Tauros finish it off its target. Before you decide to use one of these moves, you have to take into account a number of things. Bind is a 75% accurate move, which means that you should always be cautious of a potential miss. Due to this, it shouldn’t be used unnecessarily, as otherwise it has a chance of missing and giving your opponent both a free turn and a wasted Bind PP. The best times to use it are when you need to get a free switch in, as even if Onix dies due to a miss the goal is still had. Bind is also worth using if the damage puts the target in EQ/Rock Slide or Explosion range. Explosion is another move that has to be used with care. While it doesn’t have the accuracy problem of Bind, it has more of a damage problem. On average, Onix's Explosion will deal about 40% to most of the tier. Some Pokemon, such as Rhydon, Golem and Snorlax, will take almost nothing, while Gengar is outright immune. Due to this, Explosion is best used when you are confident that either the opponent won’t predict it, or those Pokèmons are out of the way. It's also able to do these things by coming in on Zapdos, Jolteon or a paralyzed Starmie’s Thunderbolt, as it’s a free switch that allows Onix to get its Bind off much more easily. This opens up another way to use Bind, as using it on the switch in is less risky, and when it works it’s just providing you with both a free switch and free momentum.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<p>
Onix could use Toxic alongside Bind to rack up damage faster, although this is risky as fast healthy Pokèmon like Alakazam and Starmie benefit immensely from poison blocking sleep and paralysis. Body Slam could also be used to help generate paralysis by itself, potentially helping it outspeed or steal KO’s with para flinching. Screech potentially has a niche to increase Onix’s low damage output, in order to buff Bind damage or provide a free slow switch to gain momentum. Screech's biggest issue is its accuracy, with only an 85% chance of landing.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
<p>
 
<b>Special attackers: </b>Onix has major issues dealing with taking Special attacks due to its pitiful 30 Special, and its multiple 4x and 2x weaknesses to common Special attacks such as Surf and Blizzard. Many of the fast threats in OU, such as Alakazam and Starmie, deal serious damage to it with their STAB Specials.<br><br>
 
<b>Snorlax: </b>Onix has a possible 5HKO with EQ on this behemoth, and its best chance is the possible 3HKO with Explosion it can use to finish it off. However, Snorlax learns the move Reflect, meaning Onix has no way to threaten it. Snorlax can then threaten it back with a wide array of options, with Blizzard, Earthquake, or paralysis from a Body Slam. Onix getting paralyzed  means that it no longer outspeeds the few things it can partial-trap with Bind, which is one of the few things that makes it notable over other Rock/Grounds.<br><br>
 
<b>Victreebel: </b>Onix gets obliterated in this matchup. Victreebel is neutral to Onix's attacks, and threatens it back with STAB Razor Leaf and a Speed Tie. Onix's only hopes is to win the Speed Tie and throw out an Explosion, which only does 65% at maximum and sacks Onix, use an Earthquake, which only does 29% at maximum, or use Bind to switch out, which gives the opponent momentum.<br><br>
