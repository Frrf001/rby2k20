<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Jynx stands as one of the best leads in the Nintendo Cup '97 format, by virtue of a very accurate Sleep in Lovely Kiss and the 30% Freeze chance of Blizzard. This can effectively give Jynx two "KO"s right out the gate in some instances, allowing it to win games on its own. This is bolstered by the fact it's a free Double Team whenever a Pokemon is taken out of commission, making it even harder to regain momentum. It's also the fastest STAB Blizzard user in the game, which alone puts it high on many Pokemon's threat-lists. With the addition of level differences as well, this can further bolster Jynx's threat level too, allowing speed creep potential in the teambuilder. Being Ice-type also makes Jynx excellent Freeze counterplay, shrugging off almost any Blizzard while being incapable of being frozen itself. Due to all of these massive benefits, Jynx is a very common sight on many Nintendo Cup 97 teams, sometimes even an automatic pick. While this does make many teams naturally prepare for it in Team Preview, the power of Jynx cannot be overstated.</p>


<p>However, Jynx has some big flaws to consider. It has absolutely pitiful defenses; for example, it can be straight up OHKOed by an L55 Tauros Hyper Beam even with level investment. Jynx's fragility is its ball and chain, which is further amplified by it being a big target for Thunder Wave. Once paralyzed, Jynx becomes significantly easier to deal with, which makes Jolteon often try to pull it off. The Sleep and Blizzard changes sprung on Jynx in any format other than Red and Green also make it much less desirable, with many teams foregoing it entirely. Substitute in Stadium Poke Cup is also a large blow, making faster Pokemon with Substitute very effective checks.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>

<p>

This is the standard Jynx set, and can be used at any level the team demands. It's recommended to add at least one level to guarantee survival against L50 Electrode trying to risk a trade with Explosion. Lovely Kiss is tied with Sleep Powder for the most accurate Sleep move in the game, and as such, is pivotal to Jynx's success. However, if an opponent has used Rest, note that the Nintendo Cup's Sleep Clause execution prevents Lovely Kiss from being used. The STAB combination of Blizzard and Psychic is completely unresisted unless it's a Jynx mirror or Starmie, which further helps it. Blizzard should be the move clicked most of the time, with the massive Freeze chance essentially making it an OHKO move that deals massive damage if it "misses". Double Team should be used after Lovely Kiss to reduce the chances of the opponent coming back after their Pokemon is taken out of commission.

<h2>Other Options</h2>

<p>

Double Team can be replaced with an all-manner of attacks, since it isn't exactly necessary. Rest can be used to block Sleep, Counter can be used against opponents trying to Body Slam Jynx for paralysis, and Substitute can be used when playing Stadium Poke Cup (and is in fact strongly recommended). Even Mimic can be used in an attempt to get a support option such as Thunder Wave. When playing Stadium Poke Cup, while it makes Jynx lose its main niche, Lovely Kiss can be replaced with the prior moves should the Sleep mechanics be too risky for a team to take a gamble on.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>

<p>Jynx lacks many safe switch-ins once it's out. The main way it will be KO'd is through its own natural inconsistency worsened by its fragility. As a general rule, speed creepers and naturally faster attackers will be threats to watch out for, as they will exploit Jynx's weaknesses the most. It should be noted that fast Pokemon with Substitute will also be effective in Stadium Poke Cup.</p>


<p>
<b>Lapras:</b> If a Pokemon has already been put to Sleep, Lapras is an extremely common switch-in for its 4x resistance to Ice and inability to be frozen by Blizzard. It also tends to carry Body Slam to paralyze Jynx while chipping at its poor defenses, thus making Lapras among the best Jynx answers around.<br><br>



<b>Starmie:</b> Starmie can sponge Jynx's STAB combination while using Recover if the going gets tough, but should fear a Freeze at all times. Typically the only way Jynx will win a head-to-head is through cheese.<br><br>



<b>Tauros:</b>  L55 Tauros can OHKO Jynx with Hyper Beam and gain significant momentum from it, unless Stadium Poke Cup is being played, in which it tries to KO or at least paralyze with Body Slam. This is a very common way players will try to claw back momentum after Jynx has crippled a Pokemon.<br><br>



<b>Chansey:</b> Jynx is forced to try and status Chansey on sight, and it isn't a favorable situation if a Pokemon has already been put to Sleep. While the chances of scoring a Freeze are in Jynx's favor, burning PP for this can be risky in the scope of a full game.<br><br>


<b>Faster attackers:</b> While only checks at best, Jynx is very frail and easy to revenge kill when worn down. As such, Dugtrio will often try to come in and KO Jynx from half health with Earthquake or Rock Slide. Jolteon and Electrode can also pose some risk, though Jolteon often has to use Body Slam or get a high roll on Pin Missile. Electrode on the other hand can try to trade with Explosion, though Jynx can a single level to survive an L50 Electrode Explosion.<br><br>
