<h1 class="title">Tradebacks Tiering Survey Results</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p> RBY2k20 is not obligated to follow Smogon's naming conventions, but I had two different possible nomenclatures in mind for our tiering, so I thought it prudent to ask the community what they would prefer. </p>

  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Number of Responses</th>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1U, 1U Banlist, 2U, 3U, etc.</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tier 1, Tier 1 Banlist, and abbreviated as T1, T2, T3, etc.</td>
    <td>5</td>

    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> There were 18 respondents to the survey. 10 respondents chose 1U, 1U Banlist, 2U, 3U, etc., which is 56% of all respondents. It is a clear majority, and so it is the nomenclature we will use for tiering on 2k20. <br>
Here is a list of what people wrote when they selected Other: <br> </p>
 <p><span class="italics"> 1T, 1TBL, 2T, 3T, 4T (T is for "Tradeback") </span></p>
 <p><span class="italics"> Tradebacks OU, Tradebacks UU ,Tradebacks NU </span></p>
 <p><span class="italics"> 1U, 2U, 3U (corresponding to smogon OU/UU/NU) </span> <br> </p>
