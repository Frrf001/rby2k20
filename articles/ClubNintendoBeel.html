<h1 class="title">Club Nintendo Mexico Giveaways
</h1>

<div id="toc"></div>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>
In 2002, Club Nintendo, the official Nintendo magazine of México, gave away Mew and Celebi to its readers. The magazine was very popular among Mexican and Latin American gamers and was responsible for contributing to the growth of the video game industry in Latin America.

</p>

<p>
Club Nintendo was founded in December 1991 by José Sierra and the late Gustavo Rodríguez, two Mexican publicists and celebrities that worked as editors of the magazine, they were accompanied by graphic designer Franciso Cuevas and writers Adrián Carbajal "Carqui" and Jesús Medina. The operation was overseen by Jorge Nogami and Teruhide Kikuchi, two businessmen from México and Japan respectively. Over the course of the years the magazine staff grew and included new members like Alejandro Ríos "Panteón" and Juan Carlos García "Master", who also worked as writers.

<p>
The magazine team had a close relationship with the staff of Nintendo of America and Nintendo Power, in fact, they traveled to the US constantly. The team also went to Japan now and then to cover important events like the Shoshinkai Show and the Space World.

<p>
Club Nintendo was also responsible for contributing to the growth of the Pokémon franchise in Latin America. In 1996, they published a small preview of Red and Green; in 1997, they witnessed the finals of the first Pokémon Tournament in History: Poké Cup; in 1999, they gave tips for Red and Blue; finally, in 2000, they organized the first Mew giveaway in México.
</p>

<h1 id="announce">The Announcement</h1>
<p>
In 2002, Nintendo of America lent the magazine Mew and Celebi distribution devices. During the year, many readers had been asking how to get those Mythical Pokémon, so Panteón thought that it would be a good idea to publish that all players who came to the magazine's offices would get a Mew and a Celebi; the staff agreed and the announcement was made.

</p>

<p>
The promotion was advertised in the August magazine’s mail section, called Doctor Mario, where one of the readers sent the following message:

"First of all, I want to congratulate you for your magazine which is very good; all my friends read it for the tricks that you post on it, but let's get right to it: I'd like to know how you can get Mew on the Yellow Version because on other websites they describe a way to get it, but it is not very well-explained and what they say is that when I go for the Hidden Machine 1 (Cut) in the S.S. Anne, after I've gotten the HM, I have to let some of the trainers in the ship beat me; after that, I have to go for the HM03 (Surf) and then return to the ship, but before I enter the dock, I have to go to the right where I'll find a truck; I have to push it with the HM04 (Strength), and then I'll find a crate which has Mew inside. I've followed these steps, but it is impossible to push the truck and I want you to explain to me how to do it, because you are good at explaining things. Alberto Rueda, Tijuana, Baja California"

</p>

</div>

<p>
The magazine staff then replied with the following:

"Very well Albert, as we have said many times, the only way to get Mew or Celebi is to get them as a gift from another Pokémon game; you can't find them inside the games. But we have good news, all the readers that come to the magazine's offices (from 12:00 to 3:00 PM), with their Game Boy, their Pokemon cartridge, and a magazine of the corresponding month, Panteón will give them these rare specimens so they can complete their collections."

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>
The next month the magazine staff made another announcement regarding the event; this is what they said:

“Since last month we’ve been assisting many readers that are great Pokémon Trainers in the magazine's offices by giving them their Mew and Celebi so they can complete their collections. We remind you that the requisites to get these Pokémon are to bring your own Game Boy (Normal, Pocket, Color or Advance), the Club Nintendo magazine of the corresponding month (this month you have to bring this issue) and that it is limited to one cartridge per magazine. The business hours will be from 12:00 to 3:00 pm, Monday to Friday. Below are pictures of some of the happy trainers that got their gifts, and we hope to count on you to make the Pokémon community grow.

We remind you of the magazine’s address so you can send your questions, comments and observations: Hamburgo No. 10, 1st floor, Colonia Juárez, México, Federal District, Postal Code 06600.

We also give you our e-mail: clubnin@nintendo.com.mx”

<p>
In October the magazine moved to Hamburgo No. 12 (which was in the same building). On the issue of that month the staff announced that the event would finish soon:

"Thanks a lot for all your letters and e-mails with suggestions and observations. On the other hand, we want to thank Panteón because thanks to his enthusiasm we have been able to give away an incredible quantity of Mew and Celebi; unfortunately, everything has to end, so this will be the last month that we'll give out these Pokémon, at least for the remainder of the year. Maybe in the future we'll do the same with a rare Pokémon that is released with the Ruby and Sapphire Versions, but that will be then; meanwhile thanks a lot to all the readers that have visited us and could complete their Pokédex. Well, it's time for us to say goodbye, but not without reminding you of the address of the magazine:

Hamburgo No. 12, Colonia Juárez, México, Federal District, Postal Code 06600.

<h1 id="event">The Event</h1>

<p>
As described above, participating in the promotion was easy; players just had to go to the offices of the magazine on a specific schedule (Monday to Friday from 12:00 to 3:00 pm), bring a Game Boy (any model), a Generation I or II game, and an issue of the magazine of the corresponding month.

The event was in charge of Panteón and Master. The writers used regular hardware for the distribution: Panteón used an Arctic White Game Boy Advance and a cartridge of Pokémon Crystal while Master used a Silver Game Boy Pocket and a cartridge of Pokémon Gold or Pokémon Silver.

To distribute the Pokémon, one of the writers had to connect his console with the player’s using a Game Boy Universal Game Link Cable, and then the player had to trade two Pokémon to get Mew and Celebi; finally, the writer had to sign the player’s magazine to mark it. In the case that the player only had a Generation I game, he could only get Mew.

</div>

<p>
Despite Club Nintendo's huge popularity, the magazine staff thought that only a small number of players would attend; however, the promotion was so successful that Panteón and Master usually had to spend entire work shifts only distributing Pokémon.

This event was unique because each player could get one pair of Mythical Pokémon per magazine (e.g., if the player brought ten magazines he could get ten Mew and ten Celebi).

Below is a list of the magazines that players could bring to the event (click the pictures of the magazines if you want to see a scanned version of them):

<h1 id="info">Pokémon Info</h1>
<p>
Mew was given away at level 5, its Original Trainer was ASH, and its only move was Pound; on the other hand, Celebi was given away at level 2; its Original trainer was HIRO; its ID was 42,534; and its moves were Leech Seed, Confusion, Heal Bell, and Recover. It is unknown if any of them had items.
</p>

<p>
Apparently both Pokémon had random IVs; for example, the Celebi above had an HP IV of 4, an Attack IV of 6, a Defense IV of 5, a Special Attack IV of 14, a Special Defense IV of 14 and a Speed IV of 8.
</p>

<h1 id="info">Stories of the Event</h1>
<p>
In the early 2000s, giveaways were huge social events where players could interact between them and meet big personalities of the industry; this promotion was not an exception because Pokémon fans took the opportunity to talk amongst themselves and have some Link Battles; the event also allowed them to meet the Club Nintendo staff, who were big celebrities back then. The writers used to talk with players about their favorite games and asked them which sections of the magazine they liked. There were many interesting stories that happened during the event; below is a list of some of them:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Since the magazine’s building security was tight, the writers sometimes had problems with the guards because they wanted young players to register with their Identity Cards (in México only adults have Identity Cards).
</li>
<li>The father of one of the players thought that the writers were going to give his son two plush dolls of Mew and Celebi, so he got confused when they told him that the Pokémon had to be delivered in the cartridge.
</li>
<li>An American kid traveled to México just for the event, accompanied by bodyguards.
</li>
<li>Panteón had a Shiny Celebi which he used to show to the players.
</li>
<li>Some parents and players gave tacos or soft drinks to the writers as a thank you gift.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>
Thanks to the effort and passion of the Club Nintendo staff many players could get two of the most rare Pokémon of the first Generations.

Distribution events were exciting because they helped to make Game Freak's philosophy of giving the people of the world enjoyment, fun and discovery while encouraging bravery, hope, kindness, and an adventurous spirit into a reality.
</p>

<h1 id="trivia">Trivia</h1>

<ul>
<li>This was the last distribution event for the original Generation I games.
</li>
<li>With 43 days, this was the third longest distribution event of Generation II (without counting weekends or the months of October and December).
</li>
<li>The magazine staff contemplated the possibility of distributing the Mythical Pokémon in other cities in México; unfortunately, the events never took place, possibly due to time constraints.
</li>
<li> When one of the readers asked Panteón how he got his Mew and Celebi, he jokingly answered, “with magic”.
</li>
</ul>
