<h1 class="title">An Introduction to Pokémon Clauses</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>

This article aims to cover and document all rulings across RBY formats, with the aim of increasing accessibility for those interested in studying rulings, playing formats, or hosting tournaments. A big part of what makes Pokémon fun for players is the flexibility it gives in rulings, and in RBY this is no different. Rulings are put in place for various reasons, such as making Pokémon more competitive or creating new and interesting metagames for people to play. However, as more formats spring up with more rulings, it can be difficult to understand or access formats with "X Clause" listed over and over again, sometimes with obscure wording.</p>



<p>

I will not be including simulator mods, which are used for quality of life enhancements rather than restrictions. However, should a rule employ a mod to serve its purpose on notable simulators, we will mention it in the notes. This article will also not cover individual bans, as they are not necessarily blanket rulings like what we're covering here. I've made the effort of adding some trivia for later generations as well, in an attempt to keep this interesting!

</p>

<h1 id="head2">Team Restrictions</h1>

<p>

Team restrictions involve rules which dictate how a team should qualify for a battle. The most common example of this is Species Clause, which prevents multiple Pokémon of the same species from participating on a single team, though this extends to team length, event legality, and more.

<h2 id="subhead1">Tiering and Team Restrictions</h1>
<p>
While not an explicit restriction, in Tiering-based metagames, such as Smogon and Pokemon Perfect's premier metagames, Pokemon in tiers above another are banned. For example, in UU, Pokemon in OU will be banned in addition to the tier's given banlist. The central aim and appeal of tiering is to produce metagames where any Pokemon can be used to a viable degree. 
</p>

<h1 id="head3">In-Battle Restrictions</h1>
<p>

While quite rare and often having little effect on a regular match, there are rules regarding what moves can be made during a battle. The most notable of these are Sleep Clause and Freeze Clause, which prevent multiple Pokémon from being, well, put to sleep or frozen by an opponent. Self-KO Clause also exists to resolve ties, dictating that the one who caused the tie loses the game.

    <td class="tg-0lax">Common RBY examples include Transform Ditto mirrors, and two Gengars using Struggle against each other, which are fixed in Stadium. There are few, if any, sets that could cause an endless battle, though in later generations Recycle + Leppa Berry is a common enabler for endless battles. Typically, this rule is enforced on platforms like Pokémon Showdown to stop the server from lagging, with battles breaching 1000 turns being declared a tie.</td>

This is run innately in Anything Goes in Pokémon Stadium. This rule is frequently contested for its lack of accuracy to mainline cartridge titles. In metagames that remove Cleric Clause, pre-statused frozen Pokemon would not count under Freeze Clause.</td>

<h1 id="head4">Move Restrictions</h1>
<p>

Pokémon has many similar moves, which often result in blanket rules being made to ban specific categories. The most common of these are Evasion Clause and OHKO Clause, which are often utilized to decrease the luck factor involved with winning games, thus making the game more competitive. However, there are sometimes more move bans than just these, such as the standard bans on Dig and Fly.

Surf Pikachu can be obtained in the Stadium games, which has historically been considered to be the first Tutor Move, and as such does not fall under Event Moves Clause unless RGB 1997 is also in use. In the case of Tradebacks, this bans NYPC Moves.</td>

    <td class="tg-0lax"><span style="font-style:normal">Name coined by RBY 2k20. This is enforced in Nintendo Cup '97 and '98 to ban Pokémon Yellow's content, as it was not released during this period, making use of them inaccurate. For more information, view </span><a href="https://rby2k20.com/read.php?article=Guides/YellowMoveGuide">this article</a><span style="font-style:normal">. This bans Event Moves from later on as well. Funnily enough, this "softbans" Kinesis outside of it being used through Metronome. This restriction is usually removed in Pokémon Stadium's iterations of the formats, as it no longer flags the moves. A similar restriction is used in VGC 2017 in Pokémon Sun and Moon.</span></td>

    <td class="tg-0lax">This has had historic use in RBY OU, though it is not enforced today. However, it does have use in metagames like 1v1 and Balanced Hackmons. It is also, effectively, used in Random Battles.</td>

    <td class="tg-yla0"><span style="font-weight:bold">OHKO Clause</span></td>

    <td class="tg-0lax">Moves that would put an opposing Pokémon to sleep are banned. This includes Spore, Sleep Powder, Lovely Kiss, Sing and Hypnosis.</td>
    <td class="tg-0lax">This is enforced solely in 1v1. The only case it's seen use outside of this is in Pokémon Black and White, where it's enforced in general, as switching resets the Sleep Counter there.</td>

<h1 id="head5">Conclusion</h1>

<p>

It can be difficult to understand rulings for a new player, often being given little description outside of a short line without any real clarity on the scope, so I hope this article has improved the clarity. RBY has many intricate rulings partly due to the nature of the game, so knowledge of them is key to teambuilding and success in the competitive scene.
