<h1 class="title">Probability In Pokémon</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>
  In Pokémon, probabilities are everywhere - move accuracies, secondary effects, paralysis chances, and so on. Every Pokémon player should know how to calculate probabilities in simple circumstances, finding the chance for the best possible outcome. In this guide, I'll look at a few different circumstances and explain how to calculate the probabilities, and show you how to generalise this to other circumstances. I have generally kept the numbers simple, ignoring the small chance for all attacks to miss in RBY, and rounding stuff like effect chances and critical hit chances.

<h1 id="SingleTurn">Probability in a Single Turn</h1>
<p>
  Often the simplest thing to look at is what can happen in a single turn, from a single Pokémon's attack. Let's look at Tauros using Body Slam on an incoming Pokémon for example. If that Pokémon is not Normal-type, there is a 30% chance of paralysis, and a 21.5% chance of a critical hit. These probabilities are independent, which means that the probability of one thing happening doesn't affect the probability of the other thing occuring. For comparison, an example of two probabilities not being independent is the probability of whether a Pokémon slower than a Tauros that isn't paralyzed but is about to take a Body Slam will fully paralyze or not. Since Tauros needs to land paralysis, the probability of fully paralyzing depends on whether or not Body Slam paralyzes, and so the probability of full paralysis is not independent of the probability of a body slam paralysis.
</p>
<p>
 A natural question to ask is "what is the probability that a Pokémon switches into Tauros Body Slam, and isn't critical hit or paralyzed?" Because being paralyzed and being critically hit are independent, to calculate this, you need to calculate the probability that the Pokémon isn't critical hit, and multiply it by the probability that the Pokémon isn't paralyzed. This is illustrated by the table below:
 </p>
 <table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Body Slam Critical Hits (21.5%)</th>
    <th>Body Slam doesn't Critical Hit (78.5%)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Body Slam Paralyzes (30%)</td>
    <td>6.5% (0.3 x 0.215)</td>
    <td>23.5% (0.3 x 0.785)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Body Slam doesn't Paralyze (70%)</td>
    <td>15% (0.7 x 0.215)</td>
    <td>55% (0.7 x 0.785)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
There are some things to note. Firstly, note that the probably of something not happening is 100% minus the probability that it does happen. Secondly, when you add up the probabilities along the row or the column, you get the original probability back, e.g. 6.5% + 23.5% = 30%, the chance of getting a body slam paralysis. Using this table, we can answer the question "what is the probability that a Pokémon switches into Tauros Body Slam and isn't critical hit or paralyzed?", seeing that it is 55%. We also answer the opposite question, "what is the probability that a Pokémon switches into Tauros Body Slam and is critical hit or paralyzed?". There are two ways you can calculate it from the table: either add up all the different probabilities where the Pokémon is critical hit or paralyzed, OR take 100% minus the probability that a Pokémon isn't critical hit or paralyzed. From the first method, we get 6.5% + 23.5% + 15% = 45%, and from the second method we get 100% - 55% = 45%. Both give us the right answer, but the second one is an easier calculation.

ideas: tauros multiple hb's / blizzards, needing a crit on slowbro, getting a freeze with chansey vs an unparalyzed one
