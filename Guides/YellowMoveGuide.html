<h1 class="title" id="title">Learnset Changes across Generation I</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
   
<p>In Nintendo's official formats, given the year, there are some differences in usable moves. This is due to Pokémon Yellow's changes, and some specific Event Pokémon. This affects Nintendo Cup '97 and '98 especially, as Pokémon Yellow wasn't actually released in 1997. This means that some moves become illegal in standard play for these formats. In terms of changes to formats that allow the moves, however, this is also relevant to Pika Cup and Petit Cup. Some Pokémon learn moves earlier, which "legalizes" them for the formats.</p>

<p>So before we get into the learnset changes, let's go over how these changes worked, why they happened, and what significance they had.</p>

<h2>Basic Learnset Changes</h2>
<p>Pokémon Yellow made many learnset changes, which were designed to make in-game play easier. As such, many of these changes can seem random or irrelevant from a competitive perspective. From an in-game perspective, it was mostly quality of life improvements. </p>

<p>Pokémon Yellow forced the player into a pretty rough early game, with Brock being immune to Pikachu's Electric-type attacks. You were essentially forced to catch Pokémon and grind the heck out of them, making the first fifteen to twenty minutes a slog. As a result of the clear difficulty players would have, as well as the fact a Pikachu owned by the player could not evolve, the developers significantly buffed Pikachu's movepool to try and make it worthwhile. They also made some Pokémon accessible much earlier, such as Mankey, who also got Low Kick to deal with Brock. Eevee's movepool was also buffed, likely to make the Rival's Eevee more interesting until it evolved. There were also some changes made for anime references, such as adding Rage as a level-up move for Primeape to reference "Primeape goes Bananas!" (though it got this via TM20 already). This can be seen more clearly with Venonat and Venomoth, which get Supersonic and Confusion to reference Koga. </p>

<p>There are more alterations to the levels some Pokémon learn moves, designed to make Pokémon like Nidoran-M better. Gyarados is a notable case of this, having its starting movepool completely changed from Hydro Pump, Bite, Leer and Dragon Rage to just Tackle. This was to balance out the fact it could be fished up in Fuchsia City. Due to this and some negligence by the Pokémon Stadium development team, Gyarados has an almost completely illegal rental in Pika Cup due to learnset incompatibilities with its Level. Through "tradebacks" with Pokémon Yellow, it's possible for some Pokémon to learn moves much earlier as well, thanks to Yellow's changes. This can legalize some moves in Pika or Petit Cup. </p>

<h2>Event Moves</h2>
<p>There are also some Event Pokémon with additional moves, though this only happened in Japan. Both of these instances came from Shogakukan Magazine promotions. Let's go over each event individually.</p>

<p>One of the biggest eyebrow-raisers is Dragon Rage Magikarp, which hasn't been seen ever since its release. This was distributed by Tamamushi University as part of a competition. Only 20 are known to have been distributed, and the medal and promotional Trading Card relating to it is worth a ton of money. This Magikarp is actually referenced in the "Pokémon Gotta Catch 'Em All" manga, with even the medal being referenced. This Magikarp is pretty well-known in the Pika Cup Generation I side format due to being one of the fastest Dragon Rage users in the format, making it a genuinely decent late-game cleaner. It's generally irrelevant everywhere else though.</p>  

<p>There was also a "Pokémon Stamp" event with a Fearow and Rapidash that know Pay Day. These were references to the Pokémon Fan Club Chairman, who states that these are his favorite Pokémon. Generally though, this has little competitive relevance and far less history to it. </p>

<p>Amnesia Psyduck or Golduck were only available in Pokémon Stadium 2 in Japan, also known internationally as our "Pokémon Stadium". You would get this through registering all 151 Pokémon in the Hall of Fame, which is an absolutely arduous task. As many know, this event defined the Pokémon by the end of Generation I, making it very worth it. </p>

<h2>Added Moves</h2>
<p>So, here's a table documenting all the changes to Pokémon's movepools after 1997. </p>
<ul>
<li>All instances of "as X", levels and HMs imply Pokémon Yellow learnset changes.</li>
<li>Pikachu can get Surf and Fly through multiple different events in Japan. As such, Raichu can also technically get these. However, these are not compatible moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what are the major relevant changes? Well, they aren't too relevant in a broad metagame sense. Most Pokémon already had the moves that defined them in the base game. Regardless, there are some changes to consider going into standard Nintendo Cup '97 when building your team. </p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/charizard.png">
<p>Charizard lacks much STAB in base Red and Green, and this partially comes from the lack of Fly. This has some minor relevance, as Fly and Dig aren't banned in Nintendo Cup '97, while still having the semi-invulnerability glitch. The addition of Fly in Yellow was so significant, it even gets a special animation in Pokémon Stadium!</p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/venomoth.png">
<p>Venomoth loses the option to go for Supersonic as part of its status guru activities. Some Venomoth builds go for a "ParaFuse" approach, eschewing Sleep Powder. This is most commonly seen in Pokémon Stadium, though we're playing RG cartridge here. For the purposes of this format, it's essentially just a lost option. </p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/golduck.png">
<p>The biggest change, by far, was to Golduck. The loss of Amnesia essentially makes it outclassed by Blastoise; it has all-rounded stats and a decent movepool, but no real direction. It vies for the position a good bit, with its selling points being Speed and nothing else. Blastoise has access to Earthquake and Fissure, both of which are substantially better options than what Golduck can offer. It also has vastly superior bulk. Contrary to popular belief, Golduck does not get Psychic in Generation I, only Confusion, a further blow to what it can do.</p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/alakazam.png">
<p>While not really a change of competitive relevance, Kinesis was actually unlearnable in Red and Green. No Pokémon learned it by level-up, and there was no TM either. Kinesis could only be called through Metronome, so while it wasn't technically unused, it was an extremely rare sight. This meant Kadabra and Alakazam did not have their signature move. It wouldn't be until wild Kadabra could be found in Pokémon Yellow that Kinesis would ever be seen as a learnable move. </p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/scyther.png">
<p>Scyther, quite literally, had no STAB in base Red and Green. With no Wing Attack, it had absolutely no usable STAB move unless it used Mimic. As a result, Scyther is relegated to being a worse Persian, relying on non-STAB Slash to deal damage. Or, it could use Swords Dance to try and make up for the lack of STAB. While the addition of Wing Attack did little to help it, it was . . . something. </p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/pinsir.png">
<p>Pinsir lacks Bind in base Red and Green, meaning it cannot abuse partial trapping for free switches and interplay. This is an important aspect of its moveset. While Pinsir isn't exactly great in Nintendo Cup '97 in the first place, it definitely adds insult to injury. </p>

   <div style="text-align: margin-left;">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/vaporeon.png">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/jolteon.png">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/flareon.png">
   </div>
<p>While a Pokémon Stadium-exclusive issue, the loss of Focus Energy was quite major for the Eeveelutions. Jolteon especially enjoys using Focus Energy to let off monumentally powerful Thunderbolts should it work. In cartridge though, this is a non-issue due to the move quite literally not working. </p>


<h2>Level-Up Learnset Changes</h2>
<p>For the purpose of optimizing when your Pokémon learns moves, using Yellow can be a potentially useful idea. This is very notable for many of the official Nintendo formats, which force you to use lower-leveled Pokémon. This does also cause legality issues in Nintendo Cup '97, as that's a Red and Green-only format. Due to the negligible changes, though, it rarely matters.</p>

<p>So, here's a table documenting all the changes to Pokémon's movepools after 1997.</p>
<ul>
<li>As with the previous table, all instances of "as X", levels and HMs imply Pokémon Yellow learnset changes.</li>
<li>Added moves are not noted to prevent redundancy.</li>
<li>When mentioning Pokémon Red and Green, note that Japanese Blue and International Blue (which is basically Green) also apply. Only Yellow carries any learnset changes. </li>
</ul>

<p>There were some game changers here across all Nintendo formats. While they weren't metagame-shifting changes, they were big buffs to some of the Pokémon allowed. 
</p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/butterfree.png">
<p>Butterfree gained a new status option in Supersonic, which while inconsistent, is relevant in Stadium and Yellow Colosseum2 due to the Sleep nerfs. Even in Red and Green, it's still an additional status that it can spread for its team. ParaFuse Butterfree is a very possible set to consider, akin to ParaFuse Venomoth in other formats. Sleep Powder also became obtainable at L15, which meant levels no longer needed to be spent on Butterfree at all unless it's for Supersonic. Overall, this is an excellent change.</p>


<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/raichu.png">
<p>Raichu is now able to get Quick Attack without spending levels in Pika Cup thanks to Pikachu's learnset changes. This is helpful against the faster threats in the format. By trading a Pikachu to the other games (or tradebacking it) to evolve it at L15 with Quick Attack, Raichu becomes a little bit more flexible in terms of teams it can fit on.</p>

<p>The Nidos got Double Kick much, much earlier, which gives them more coverage in Pika Cup. This is helpful for covering Chansey, and is a very relevant change. While they need to be L16 to be used (in order to evolve the babies), it's very much worth considering if your team composition is already headed in that level balance direction.</p>

   <div style="text-align: margin-left;">

<p>The Eeveelutions got a ton of love, with Eevee getting improved Petit Cup viability across the board. With Quick Attack now being costless level-wise, it gets priority that is actually a mainstay in its moveset. This can be called the most relevant change from Yellow, honestly. Vaporeon and Flareon, however, require two more levels to use Hydro Pump and Flamethrower due to Yellow changes being disallowed generally, decreasing their viability in Nintendo Cup '97. This makes them much more difficult to fit on some teams, such as L52-52-51 compositions. Instead, should they use these moves, they will usually be on L55-50-50 compositions. These tend to fall apart more easily should their "boss" be KOed. There are workarounds for all these though, and for Flareon, it's hardly relevant as Fire Blast is usually used anyway. Oh, and they all got some moves for Nintendo Cup '98, but they're not too relevant due to better options via TM.<p>
