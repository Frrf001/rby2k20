<h1 class="title">Introduction to RBY OU</h1>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction :</h1>

<p>When we compare RBY OU with more recent Generations, RBY OU is a whole different world. With many weird mechanics, and with only a handful of viable Pokémon, RBY OU may not be easily understandable for new players. This guide intends to give new players a broad overview of what the tier is.</p> 

<p>As I said earlier, RBY OU has a ton of strange mechanics. I won't talk about it here, because we have a RBY mechanics guide! I strongly advise you to read it before going further. Weird mechanics are ubiquitous in RBY, and if don’t know them, you will probably not understand the following. </p>

<h1 id="The 15 OverUsed Pokémon">The 15 OverUsed Pokémon :</h1> 

<h2 id="Big 3">The Big 3 :</h2> 

<p>there are the three most played Pokémon. They are present in all games and are essential to all serious teams :</p> 

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/tauros.png">

<p>-Tauros : Tauros is the king of the RBY OU. Fast and powerful, his STAB Body Slam and Hyper Beam are devastating, making it a universal revenge killer and a great wincond. With a critical hit rate of 20%, it is easy for him to beat his checks. Body Slam can paralyze his opponents such as Starmie. His correct movepool allows him to hit Normal resists: Blizzard threatens Golem and Rhydon and Earthquake beats Gengar.</p> 
	 
 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/snorlax.png">   
   
<p>-Snorlax : Thanks to his great bulk, and his access to Reflect, Snorlax can check a lot of top tier Pokémon like Tauros, Chansey, and other Snorlax. Offensively, Snorlax is also a great threat: with an Attack of 110, it’s hard for any Pokémon to come in one of his Body Slams. Like Tauros, he has access to Hyper Beam, but also to Selfdestruct.</p>
 
  <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/chansey.png">

<p>-Chansey : With a Special of 105, Chansey is both bulky and powerful. Her immense HP allows her to switch in to a lot of Pokémon without difficulty. Very versatile, Chansey can be played offensively, with the BoltBeam combo, or defensively, with Reflect, Sing, or Counter.</p> 

<h2 id="Psychic Type">Psychic Type :</h2> 

<p>The Psychic type is one of the best types in Generation I. Offensively, it is only resisted by itself, and defensively, only the Bug type, absent at high levels, is super effective against it. Generally, Psychic-types have pretty good stats and movepools, allowing them to be present in all team. Who are they ? </p>

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/exeggutor.png">

<p>-Exeggutor : He is the historical sleeper of the tiers. His pretty good stats, paired with a good movepool (including Explosion, Mega Drain, Hyper Beam, Stun Spore, and Double-Edge) make him a good pick. Thanks to his Grass type, he is the only true answer to Rhydon. 
 
 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/starmie.png">

<p>-Starmie : Fast, bulky and versatile, Starmie is a very solid pick. His large move pool allows him to have a lot of offensive options: in addition to Surf and Psychic, he has access to the BoltBeam combo. Finally, with Thunder Wave and Recover, he is a perfect support for the rest of the team. He works well as a lead, where he can spread the paralysis early in the game and absorb sleep, but he is also a great sixth Pokémon, thanks to his ability to deal with a lot of threats, like Tauros, Snorlax, Cloyster, and Alakazam.</p> 
	 
 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/alakazam.png">

<p>-Alakazam: with a special of 135 and a 25% critical hit rate, Alakazam is a powerful Special attacker. He has access to Thunder Wave and Recover, and he is a good support Pokémon. He is offensively limited; beyond Psychic, his only options are Seismic Toss and Reflect. Defensively, he can easily switch in against all Special attacker like Chansey, Starmie, and other Alakazam. Physically fragile, it is easy to pressure him while he is paralyzed. While he is most often seen as a lead, thanks to his ability to spread paralysis in the early game and to absorb sleep, it is not uncommon to see him in the sixth solt.</p>  

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/jynx.png">

<p>-Jynx: Jynx is a fast sleeper. Her Lovely Kiss is pretty viable thanks to its high accuracy. She has access to Blizzard, a powerful STAB that can freeze the opponent early in the game. Always seen as a lead, her low physical bulk make her weak to Normal moves coming from Snorlax, Tauros, and Exeggutor. </p> 

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/slowbro.png">

<p>-Slowbro: Thanks to his access to Amnesia, Slowbro is a dangerous sweeper. He also has access to Thunder Wave, which allows him to beat some of his checks. Slowbro suffers from many problems; using Amnesia takes a lot of turns, which allows your opponent to fish for critical hits with Thunderbolt from a Chansey or a Starmie. Slowbro can only heal himself with Rest, which makes the field free for physical Attackers to pressure him or to Explode, often inflicting enough damage to finish him with Tauros.</p>  

<h2 id="Other Viable Pokémon">Other viable Pokémon :</h2> 

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/rhydon.png">

<p>-Rhydon : Rhydon is very powerful; his great Attack and Defense stats make him an immense threat. His typing allows him to perfectly check Zapdos and Jolteon. He has access to Body Slam, paralyzing his checks like Starmie, preventing them from coming onto the field easily. He resists Normal-type moves, which allows him to absorb Explosion, Self-Destruct, and Hyper Beam from Snorlax and Tauros.</p> 

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/zapdos.png">  <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/jolteon.png">

<p>-Zapdos and Jolteon: Zapdos is the only mixed attacker in RBY OU. With Drill Peck, Thunderbolt, and a high critical hit rate, it is easy for him to beat his common checks such as Chansey and Snorlax. He is played with Agility, allowing him to clean the late game. Jolteon is less bulky than Zapdos, and he is weak to Earthquake. On the other hand, he is a solid check to Zapdos, since he resists his two STAB moves. With Double Kick and a 25% critical hit rate, he can easily beat Chansey. Finally, he have a great longevity, thanks to Rest and an average bulk, allowing him to come on Starmie and Zapdos safely. </p>

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/gengar.png">

<p>-Gengar: He is the fastest sleeper of the game. With his Normal immunity, he can easily come onto the field to sleep an opponent. He also has access to Explosion, threatening a lot of Pokémon. Finally, his movepool is pretty poor; he is forced to use Seismic Toss or Mega Drain as the fourth slot. </p>

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/cloyster.png">

<p>-Cloyster: With 180 in Defense, Cloyster can easily come in on all physical Attackers of the tier, especially Snorlax and Tauros. Thanks to Blizzard and Explosion, it is pretty risky for the opponent to send a Pokémon onto the field safely. Finally, Clamp gives Cloyster a free switch. </p>

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/lapras.png">

<p>-Lapras: A relic of the past, Lapras has pretty average stats and a good movepool, with access to Blizzard, Thunderbolt, Sing, Hyper Beam, and Body Slam. Sadly, it is hard for him to come onto the field and he is hard walled by every Chansey. Finally, the rise of Cloyster and Sing Chansey made him fall into oblivion.</p> 

 <img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/victreebel.png">

<p>-Victreebel: Another relic of the past, Victreebel could take advantage of a meta based on paralysis. Indeed, when the opposing team is paralyzed, Victreebel wreaks havoc and outright prevents the opponent from playing by using Wrap! Sleep Powder allows him to neutralize the last non-statused Pokémon, and Razor Leaf, which always result in a critical hit, can beat Starmie. However, currently, Victreebel is limited; players no longer allow their Pokémon to be paralyzed as easily</p>as before. </p>


<h1 id="Battling">Battling in RBY OU :</h1>

<p>Now that you know what Pokémon are viable in the tier, and how they are used, I will be able to broach the subject of the battle.</p>

<h2 id="Early Game">Early Game :</h2>

<p>The first turns of the battle are crucial. Your choice of lead and how you play it is very important, as it’s characteristic to the strategy of your team. Putting an opposing Pokémon to sleep is very important, and it should be your goal in the early game. Indeed, due to weird sleep mechanics, a sleeping Pokémon has a great chance of not waking up in the short term. So, a sleeping Pokémon is pretty much a dead Pokémon. In RBY OU, there are 7 playable leads : Starmie, Alakazam, Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, Chansey, and Jolteon. We can class these 7 leads in 2 categories : « paralead » and « sleep lead ». Starmie, Alakazam and Jolteon, as a lead, are paraleads. Obviously, their work is to spread status, especially paralysis, in early game in order to handicap the opposing pokemon, and to pressure them with powerful pokemon like Snorlax. So, in most of the cases, in the first turn, you are going to click Thunder Wave. But, it’s not that simple. Since it is very important to put an opposing pokemon to sleep, you have to be careful when you paralyse a pokemon, in order to not give your opponent a free sleep blocker. Let’s take a look at an example : you led with Alakazam and your opponent led with a Jynx. Your sleeper is a Sing Chansey with Ice Beam, Thunder Wave, and Soft-Boiled. On the first turn, you should not click Thunder Wave. Indeed, if you paralyze the opposing lead, and then take the sleep with your Alakazam, when your Chansey will be on the field and tries to use Sing, your opponent will simply send in Jynx to block your sleep. And then, with only 5 active Pokémon versus 6 for your opponent, you are clearly disadvantaged. So, you should be very careful on the first turn of the battle, and don’t always click brainless Thunder Wave. In other cases, you may want to switch your paralead into Chansey, against other paralead. There are two reason why you can make this move :</p> 
<p>-you want to keep your lead unparalyzed. This scenario often occurs when you play a Starmie lead. An unparalyzed Starmie is a precious pokemon as his great speed and his good bulk allows him to check and revenge kill Rhydon and Tauros, thing he can’t do when he’s paralyzed.</p>
<p>-you want to keep the opposing lead unparalyzed. At first glance, this scenario could be weird, but, this makes sense if you are plaing a Sing Chansey who struggles to put to sleep a paralyzed Starmie or a paralyzed Alakazam. Moreover, sending out your Chasney the first turn garantee you to put to sleep an pokemon before your opponent, giving you the initiative.</p> 
<p>Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Chansey, as a lead, are « sleep lead ». The goal of this lead is to put to sleep an opposing pokemon in really early game, and then taking the initiative with threatening pokemon. Jynx is the most viable because there is no situation in whiwh he will not use Lovely Kiss on the first turn. Conversely, Exeggutor, Gengar and Chansey have some poor match-up. Exeggutor is only good against Alakazam. Gengar hates facing Psychic type like Alakazam and Starmie, whiwh forces him to switch out turn 1. As the fastest sleeper of the tier, Gengar will take advantage of it clicking Hypnosis against other sleep lead. Chansey lead has positive match-up against paralead but he is also the slowest sleeper of the tier making his match-up against other sleep lead really tough. As soon as you landed the sleep, you can begin to pressure the opposing team with your pokemon. Classically, we send Tauros or Snorlax who force the opponent to switch out and to take damage with another pokemon. Keep in mind that your opponent can also send onto the field a problematic pokemon, like a sleeper (Exeggutor/Chansey) forcing out your pokémon.</p>

<h2 id="Midgame">Midgame :</h2>

<p>There is not a lot to say in this part. It all depends on your team and the opposing team. Try to remove Pokémon that bother your wincon. For example, to prepare the late game sweep of your Zapdos, you have to remove Rock-types that wall Zapdos. This type of interaction depends on your team strategy. For some teams, the team strategy relies on having heavy paralysis support, to sweep with Snorlax or Rhydon, and for others, you just need to paralyze some Pokémon to support your wincon. So, you have to design your team to support your wincon. Still, with the Zapdos example, you can pair Zapdos with a Surf Snorlax, in order to lure opposing Rhydon, that thought they could come onto the field for free.</p>

<h2 id="End Game">End Game :</h2>

<p>Like in the previous part, the end game definitely varies a lot game to game. The most common scenario is a Tauros duel. Two Body Slam and one Hyper Beam will kill the opposing Tauros. Keep in mind that you don’t always have to stay in versus the opposing Tauros ; you can try to absorb the Hyper Beam with a Starmie, a Snorlax, or a Rhydon. Be aware of the stakes when you decide to try your luck with a speed tie or when you decide to switch ; you have to play safely, and don’t take certain risks if you don't need to. </p>
