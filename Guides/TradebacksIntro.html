<h1 class="title">A Quick Introduction To RBY 1U</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>
   In RBY OU, trading back Pokémon from Gold, Silver, and Crystal isn't legal, but it is legal in RBY 1U. This article will highlight the biggest differences between RBY 1U and RBY OU, stemming from the legality of tradebacks in the tier.
</p>

<h1 id="newmoves">New Moves</h1>

<h2 id="snorlax">Snorlax</h2>

<p>
   One of the most significant changes in RBY 1U compared to RBY OU is that <a href="https://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Snorlax">Snorlax</a> learns Lovely Kiss. Snorlax is one of the most dangerous Pokémon in RBY OU, and gaining access to Lovely Kiss only further ups the ante. Unlike other good sleepers, it is extremely slow, without a speed advantage against anything ever seriously used in the metagame, but it is also far more difficult to switch into, especially with paralyzed Pokémon, making its Lovely Kiss very difficult to deny.
</p>

<h2 id="hypno">Hypno</h2>

<p>
   The other monumental change from OU to 1U is that Hypno learns Amnesia. <a href="https://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Hypno">Hypno</a> shoots up from being a barely relevant Pokémon in OU to being a defining Pokémon in 1U. Hypno is faster and has fewer vulnerabilities than OU's prime Amnesia abuser, Slowbro. From preliminary testing, it seems that it should have a place on most 1U teams.
</p>

<h2 id="tauros">Tauros</h2>

<p>
   In bad news for Rhydon and Golem, <a href="https://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Tauros">Tauros</a> learns a new coverage move in RBY 1U — Surf. While not every Tauros will run it, and it doesn't OHKO Rhydon without a critical hit, it still does such immense damage that Rhydon and Golem will have to be even more afraid of Tauros than they are in OU!
</p>

<h2 id="zam">Alakazam</h2>

<img src="images/sprites/alakazam.png">

<p>
   <a href="https://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Alakazam">Alakazam</a> gets a nice little upgrade through tradebacks. It now learns Ice Punch and Thunder Punch, giving it coverage options against Exeggutor and Starmie, and the ability to fish for freezes.
</p>

<h2 id="gengar">Gengar</h2>

<img src="images/sprites/gengar.png">

<p>
   <a href="https://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Gengar">Gengar</a> learns Ice Punch, which has great coverage alongside Thunderbolt. It lets it fish for freezes against Chansey and does more damage to Exeggutor and Rhydon than Night Shade.
</p>

<h2 id="cat">Persian</h2>

<img src="images/sprites/persian.png">

<p>
   <a href="https://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Persian">Persian</a> learns some great new moves via tradebacks, though they might not have that big of an impact. One move that Persian learns is Hypnosis. While sleep moves are excellent in general on fast Pokémon, it's quite inaccurate, and Persian is frail, with a typing that offers it few benefits defensively. Amnesia is another great move Persian learns, but it's nowhere near as game-changing a move for Persian as it is for Hypno, as Persian is primarily a physical attacker, unlike Hypno.

<p>
   A lot of other Pokémon learn valuable new moves, though it is less certain whether any of these will be viable or common options in 1U. Here are a number of notable gains:
<ul>
<li> <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Exeggutor">Exeggutor</a> learns Headbutt. Headbutt is more accurate than Egg Bomb and Hyper Beam, has no recoil, unlike Double-Edge, and has a flinch chance, so in spite of its lower base power than the other options, it might see some use in 1U.</li>
<li> <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Jynx">Jynx</a> learns Petal Dance. While the move's locking effect is a major downside, and its base power is quite low, it is an interesting option that could be used to lure Starmie in the right circumstances.</li>
<li> <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Nidoking">Nidoking</a> and <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Nidoqueen">Nidoqueen</a> both learn Lovely Kiss. Nidoking also learns Amnesia, but it's incompatible with Lovely Kiss. Nidoqueen's better defensive stats let it avoid being 2HKO'd by common Ice-type attacks as often as Nidoking is, so it is usually the preferred Nido to use in 1U. </li>
<li> Two other Pokémon which learn Hypnosis via tradebacks are the Fire-types <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Ninetales">Ninetales</a> and <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Rapidash">Rapidash</a>. Though neither is likely to be a strong choice in RBY 1U, fast Pokémon with access to sleep moves are never to be ignored.
<li> <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Seaking">Seaking</a> learns Swords Dance! With access to STAB Surf to deal with Normal-type resists such as Rhydon and Golem, Agility to boost its speed, and its fairly average stats, it's something not to ignore completely, though whether it will prove to be a viable option or merely a fun gimmick remains to be seen. </li>
<li> Each of the Eeveelutions learn Growth via tradebacks, and of the three <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Vaporen">Vaporeon</a> is the one to benefit the most. No longer entirely in Lapras's shadow, it finds itself competing instead with Slowbro. It has higher Special, greater special bulk, and more Speed than Slowbro, though it lacks Slowbro's coveted secondary Psychic typing and STAB. </li>
<li> <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Raichu">Raichu</a> learns Sing. While it's horribly inaccurate, it's a nice extra tool for Raichu to work with, though it'll probably be a lot more noteworthy in lower tiers.
<li> <a href="ttps://rby2k20.com/poke.php?meta=rby1u&mon=Electabuzz">Electabuzz</a>'s coverage improves significantly through tradebacks. It gains access to Ice Punch, making it the only Electric-type which can hit both Exeggutor and Rhydon super-effectively with a single coverage move. It also learns Rolling Kick, which is a great option against Chansey, doing a minimum of 30% if it hits, and having a 30% flinch chance. Electabuzz could have a serious role in RBY 1U.
</ul>
