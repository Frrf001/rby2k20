<h1 class="title">Generation I's Other Metas - Nintendo Cup 1999</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>While many RBY players will talk about the history of the game, few will venture too far from the norm: the Azure Heights Forum, Pokémon Online, the rise of Smogon, and Pokémon Perfect, for example. However, a thing many players will forget about is Nintendo's officially sanctioned formats for Generation I. This was a big part of the marketing in Japan, with TV shows such as 64 Mario Stadium televising matches. But to play Pokémon, you need a format. So I introduce to you: Nintendo Cup.</p>

<p>Nintendo Cup was a sequence of annual tournaments using unique formats. These went on from 1997 to 2000. '97-99 played RGB (and Yellow once released), while 2000 played GS. I'll be focusing on Nintendo Cup 1999 (abbreviated as NC99) for this article. With <a href="http://pokemon.s20.xrea.com/">Pokemon Battle Historia</a> in the Japanese community keeping the Nintendo Cup tradition going, why don't we take a look at how it works? </p>

<h2 id="Ruleset">Ruleset</h2>
<p>Nintendo Cup 1999 banned the Pokémon that topped major events in '97 and '98, creating what's effectively the UU format for this period. Unlike formats such as Smogon OU, Team Preview was performed through showing the opponent your team, which was all L50. It was also 3v3, with Species Clause, Sleep Clause and Self-KO Clause. However, there was no OHKO Clause or Evasion Clause. You may recognize this as a similar ruleset to Battle Stadium in Pokémon Sword and Shield . . . that's because it pretty much is the ruleset!  </p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 0px auto 0px auto;"><p>So, what Pokemon were banned? Let's see...</p>
<img src="images/articles/NC99Banlist.png"></div>

<p>As you can see, many staples are gone, such as Chansey and Alakazam. But you do also see some outliers, such as Aerodactyl. You also see some Pokémon such as Electrode and Dugtrio who are known for their Speed; these two were extremely popular in '97 for their ability to outspeed even L55 threats without spending levels, which was very valuable. They also avoid OHKO moves, while Dugtrio specifically has a Fissure that is almost impossible to be unaffected by through speed. This banlist is some incredible history!</p>

<h2 id="The Format">So how does the format work?</h2>
<p>Nintendo Cup has some profound differences to your average RBY game. Team Preview alone changes a lot, removing the potential of surprise threats and allowing for more prepared team choices. 3v3 teambuilding also removes the need for having less overlapping types, and more complex cores can be made. The reintroduction of OHKO Moves can make Pokémon such as Rapidash fun gimmicks to use as well. These games are typically very fast and momentum-based, making for a good change of pace from the long RBY battles that we know these days. </p>

<p>Being on Japanese cartridge also means that there are some different mechanics. There's the Binding move wrong side fainting glitch and Swift effect glitch, for example. The latter causes evasion to be a good bit better, as, due to a bug, the accuracy bypass effect only works on Substitutes! Also, Blizzard has a 30% Freeze chance, of course.</p>

<p>So, what Pokémon see frequent use in this format? Well, let's talk about the top four.</p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/slowbro.png">
<p>Slowbro <br>
-  Amnesia <br>
-  Psychic <br>
-  Thunder Wave <br>
-  Earthquake / Surf / Rest <br> </p>
<p> Slowbro is the undisputed king of the format, with its Amnesia access allowing it to quickly clean up teams once its checks are removed. While there are ways to play around it such as Sleep, OHKO Moves, Victreebel, and the two major resident Electric-types, it's usually a case of trying to revenge kill it due to the difficulty countering it once it's set up. Besides that, Earthquake also decimated the Electric-types and Haunter. It's a far cry from Tauros and Snorlax's dominance in Generation I and II's OU formats, but it's a threat that demands respect. </p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/persian.png">
<p>Persian <br>
-  Slash <br>
-  BubbleBeam <br>
-  Thunderbolt  <br>
-  Substitute <br> </p>
<p> Persian is the Tauros of the format, but is slightly held back by Haunter and Rhydon (though the latter is 2HKOed by BubbleBeam). Even Slowbro is 3HKOed by Slash, and Substitute can provide it with some extra potential hits to wrestle the thing down. Its main flaw, however, is the fact it will rarely OHKO a threat. With this in mind, many Pokémon such as Electabuzz, Mr. Mime and Kadabra will purposefully carry Counter to take the heavy damage, and then flip the situation on Persian completely. Submission also tends to be carried on Pokémon that can afford it, though this is rarer and more for Pokémon like Omastar.</p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/haunter.png">
<p>Haunter <br>
- Thunderbolt / Thunder <br>
- Psychic <br>
- Mega Drain / Night Shade / Confuse Ray <br>
- Explosion / Night Shade / Confuse Ray <br> </p>
<p> Haunter is a very varied threat in the format. Thunder is the preferred move of choice for the 2HKO on Slowbro and 3HKO on Persian, though Thunderbolt can be used for consistent hits. However, Thunderbolt is usually a roll in regards to whether the KO calcs do their job. Haunter's main job is to check the top threats while making use of its immunities for its teammates (e.g. Persian dislikes Submission, so Haunter comes in). However, its Speed is a small problem: being a base-95 means that threats such as Electabuzz love to capitalize on it, coming in and threatening with paralysis to cripple it. Being one of the best Pokémon to check the format comes with a big target on your back!</p>

<img style="margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial;" src="images/sprites/electabuzz.png">
<p>Electabuzz <br>
-  Thunderbolt <br>
-  Psychic <br>
-  Counter <br>
-  Substitute <br> </p>
<p> Electabuzz is another Pokémon with the coveted 2HKO on Slowbro, using Thunderbolt as its move of choice. Psychic rounds out the neutral coverage for it to hit the metagame, opening two free slots. Counter + Substitute is an excellent combo, with Counter triggering even if a Substitute is broken in RGBY. This allows it to murder Persian, who has a 99.6% chance to 2HKO with Slash otherwise. It's often paired with Slowbro to deal with Rhydon, though it has to fear Horn Drill. </p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Prior to the making of this article, I actually explored Nintendo Cup 1999 myself, and even <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UastG9UNbdCp8DR97Ay7gTAI-sxAqs1xb9gAJ2jCvEc/edit?usp=sharing">made a spreadsheet</a> with dozens of resources. While this article is only a brief introduction to the metagame, I encourage you to read my spreadsheet and acquaint yourself with this unique format. I think that this and other original official formats could be a fun format for RBY players to explore. Maybe in the future, there will be tournaments in this format on RBY2k20! There could even be resources on-site.</p>
